The marketing department relies on information to evaluate the potential of product success. Marketers also use the same information to reach out to their intended targets. Most importantly, you need all your business information in one place to make trading and transaction documents.

In that case, you’d want an innovative documentation platform that guarantees information safety and multiple access for employee collaboration. You can leverage a [reliable ](https://www.docsie.io/)[system like ](https://www.docsie.io/)[Do](https://www.docsie.io/)[csie](https://www.docsie.io/) to manage your internal software documentation. 

Read on as we explore the 5 key benefits of using a documentation platform for maintaining software documentation in your business.

1. **Enhanced Security**

As an online business, your primary concern should be the [security of your information](https://medium.com/the-mission/data-security-how-to-keep-your-customers-information-safe-a3150510a7b7) and customer data. Security is a big challenge that many organizations have to deal with, especially during the pandemic when cyber insecurity is on the rise. It can even be worse if you rely on manual documentation as it is easily accessible to anyone. Sensitive information may land into the hands of the wrong person, who may end up leaking it to competitors.

Getting a strong documentation platform for maintaining your software documents guarantees water-tight security. Software documentation platforms have a digital trail, and you can easily track unauthorized access. Whether the access is from within or without, you can retrieve the editor’s information, including the time of access. Thus, you can quickly tell if there is an external attack or just a dishonest employee. 

Most importantly, you can regulate persons that can access certain document based on position and clearance. That makes it easy to manage employees in their respective departments.

1. **Improved, Automated Workflow**

Every business drafts and compiles various documents on a routine basis. By the end of the month, when it’s time to reconcile the period’s work, every department would need copies of the documents. It can be quite challenging to recreate copies without wasting time and resources. 

Moreover, humans get tired of doing repetitive tasks for long periods. Besides running out of time, you’ll likely end up with disorganized files.

A reliable software documentation platform ensures flawless communication lines to both internal and external departments. You can easily classify documents as you generate them. Hence, you enhance speedier and streamlined business processes to [save on costs of operation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/03/25/15-smart-ways-you-can-save-money-as-a-new-business/). This can also keep you from losing revenue due to insufficient data.

1. **Enhanced Backup and Recovery**

The last thing that you want for your business is to lose data. It will be like a new startup because you’ll need to build a new customer database. You may also lose your fortunes if vital information like bank details land in the hands of the bad guys. 

Not to forget, you’ll not experience a favorable competitive environment if you lose all the data that built your business from scratch. It will hardly ever be the same again, especially if the company is a decade-plus old.

Innovative software documentation platform enhances your backup and recovery process. If you lose all data, say because of an internal technical hitch, you’ll retrieve the same in less than an hour. The platform also helps if your primary backup system gets compromised. You can easily restore data without parting with any ransom.

1. **Easier Retrieval**

The average online consumer will expect your brand to solve their issue in about three hours during working days. Otherwise, you’ll get complaints all over the brand’s social media messages. The last thing that you want is losing regular customers and scaring away prospective clients. Moreover, you’d also like to cut down customer care costs as much as possible for better profit margins.

Acquiring an [advanced ](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8026-choosing-a-document-management-system.html)[software documentation platform](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8026-choosing-a-document-management-system.html) means you can easily retrieve files in seconds. You can leverage retrieval tips like searching by word, phrase, or the customer’s credentials.  For larger business files, you can arrange them by index hence easier number reference.

1. **Version Control**

Businesses handle various types of documents, including confidential and public. Some documents require a specific department's input only, but still, other workers may need access. 

For instance, some finance documents like quarterly and annual reports should only have the accounts department’s input. Even so, employees and shareholders also need to access it to see the company’s growth and whether their commitment is paying off.

Modern software documentation platforms allow you to share files in different versions. For instance, a “read only” version would suffice for sensitive accounting documents. You can also automate the process of sharing such customized documents.

**Bottom Line**

Automating document management using advanced software is inevitable for your business’ success. Apart from lowering operations costs, it guarantees the business' perpetual existence. You’ll enjoy reliable data backup and retrieval processes.

Throughout the customer journey, people search for information and guidance to support their purchasing decisions. Before a purchase, customers want to understand how a product works and whether it will meet their requirements. During and after a purchase, customers will appreciate documentation detailing how to configure and use your service – helping them shape and mold functionality to meet their needs.

To quote Matshona Dhliwayo – ""Knowledge is wealth."" Modern digital consumers are privileged to have a wealth of knowledge at their fingertips, courtesy of the internet. For enterprises that lack the capacity or ability to share knowledge on their services – this means they are losing out on a distinct, information-driven competitive advantage.

This is confirmed by a recent 2020 [Eptica](https://www.eptica.com/dcx2020)[ study](https://www.eptica.com/dcx2020), where 36% of business respondents are failing to answer routine customer queries via digital channels. In a best-case scenario, these failures will drive up demand in the customer service department as people request information – increasing staff costs and workloads. The worst-case scenario is customer abandonment. Customers will find a competitor offering more pre- and post-sale documentation, thus improving confidence and the likelihood of following through on a purchase.



### Answering Routine Queries With a Self-Service Documentation Portal

### 

Routine queries are common, low-level questions concerning aspects of your product or service – including configuration, billing, and technical support. In most cases, query types will remain consistent, with similar questions being answered with equally similar responses from customer service agents. These low-level workloads are repeatable and predictable, making them ideal candidates for self-service.

By implementing a self-service documentation portal, businesses can reduce their customer support workloads. This coincides with shifting consumer sentiment. A 2020 [ContactBabel](http://connect.creativevirtual.com/contactbabel-report-us-mar2020)[ study](http://connect.creativevirtual.com/contactbabel-report-us-mar2020) found that 61% of US respondents identified AI-enabled self-service as 'very important.' This demonstrates how customers not only accept contact-free support, they embrace it. In particular, millennials want to serve themselves – with 73% of consumers in this [Aspect study](https://www.aspect.com/company/news/press-releases/customer-serve-thy-self-new-study-reveals-millennials-desire-for-self-service-digital-interaction-to-change-customer-service-forever) saying they should have the ability to solve problems independently.



### Using Docsie for WordPress Documentation

### 

To help consumers help themselves, implementing a documentation portal is essential. Docsie is a great way to manage and share documentation across the entire business – catering to both your loyal customers, and passionate internal employees!



### Docsie Workspaces, Books, and Shelves

Within a Docsie workspace, businesses can craft and store documentation to be published in a documentation portal. For individual products, Docsie provides a 'shelf' on which related documentation – or 'books' – can be organized and managed. Business users can create as many 'books' and 'shelves' as they require, making Docsie organizable and highly-scalable. This documentation will collectively form a 'library' where staff can add knowledge and customers can use this knowledge to learn about your products and services.



![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/cdhlmjjaoteiufwqsqba)



### Docsie Document Versioning

Docsie also enables document versioning, keeping multiple iterations of a document organized and available long-term. This is ideal for development teams. New product releases and API updates can be documented, with historical documentation as a backup for customers that continue using older versions of your products and services – efficiently catering to a fragmented user base.



![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/pczuxadvbygftlmwekbo)



### Docsie Custom Documentation Hubs

Each brand looks and feels different. Docsie enables custom branding across all documentation, integrating company logos, color schemes, and typography for consistent publishing on company websites. This allows businesses to change branding assets once in Docsie and propagate these changes across all documents on any hosting platform – streamlining branding management.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/mshntomlogkgyplixkup)



### Docsie Machine Learning Language Translation

Global enterprises need to communicate knowledge in multiple languages. Docsie provides further management of translated documentation, creating alternative 'books' on each product 'shelf' for different languages. These 'books' can be manually transcribed, or businesses can opt for Docsie's built-in machine translation feature.

Machine translation will automatically translate documents into various languages – an important feature considering 75% of respondents were more likely to make a purchase if support was provided in their local language, according to a 2020 CSA research [study](https://csa-research.com/More/Media/Press-Releases/ArticleID/655/Survey-of-8-709-Consumers-in-29-Countries-Finds-that-76-Prefer-Purchasing-Products-with-Information-in-their-Own-Language).

### Docsie Vocally: Visualized Feedback

Docsie Vocally allows users to provide feedback on individual 'books' in a documentation portal. This helps businesses identify useful and impactful documentation that offers measurable benefits to users. It also helps businesses find non-performant documentation, which should be revised and replaced to offer more value to customers. Feedback consists of 'emotional ratings' on a 5-point rating scale or text messages containing explanations for feedback. Businesses can dive deeper into user experience (UX) monitoring with recorded actions on pages for each user, illustrating customer browsing habits in relation to their feedback to guide business decisions.

### Getting Started With Docsie on WordPress 5

### 

Businesses can use Docsie's functionality to manage their documentation while hosting items on a platform of their choice – in this case, WordPress. Publishing to WordPress from within Docsie could not be simpler, requiring a single deployment script to push and publish content.



### Docsie WordPress Deployment Script Creation

Open the Book you wish to publish in Docsie.

In the Settings panel, locate Properties.



![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/pmfgayfjbxpyaezonadq)

Click (get self-publish script)

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/gapavaasxhjgmzvosbtt)

Your code will appear ready to copy into WordPress.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/eeugiunjmalaxajwytjx)

Additionally, in the Portal view, businesses can select existing documentation from each shelf or an entire workspace to publish.

Included here are Content Filters - Support, Site Content, Terms and Policy, Documentation, Other Pages – offering granular control over what gets published to WordPress.

Businesses can also choose Display Styles – including Version Picker, Language Picker, Section Anchors, Footer Navigation – controlling the final formatting output on WordPress.

Business users simply choose what to publish, defining content filters and display styles through the graphical user interface (GUI) – with Docsie generating a final deployment script in the lower Text Area. This is known as low-code or codeless.

Now we can publish to WordPress!



### Adding the Script to WordPress



After logging into the WordPress dashboard, navigate to Pages.

Select Add new page and create a title, or select an existing page.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/lbwsgahnmezbvkzftagh)

In the WordPress text editor, click the Add button on a website block. Select the Custom HTML option to add Docsie’s code script.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/ejdtdgrlzsahtursowbf)

Copy your deployment script in Docsie to add it to the clipboard. Then in WordPress, paste the code string into your Custom HTML box. You can also specify a WordPress page name, though Docsie will control titling for you automatically in the embedded document.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/zrmyjvznfrgterpdolmk)

The final step is clicking Preview next to HTML at the top of the page in the WordPress editor.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/eiliooqudyhoghurdeqp)

Your Docsie documentation will appear seamlessly on the page! You can now click Update in the top right to publish to your live webpage. This quick and easy process can be repeated with all of your documentation. It supports rapid publishing for small and large documentation libraries; simply paste and go!

NOTE – WordPress 5 will show its own title and other website elements using this method, perfect for embedding Docsie documents around other website elements. If you want to load nothing but the Docsie document - paste your code string into the HTML footer of your page in the WordPress Code Editor, and leave the rest of the page blank.



### Collaborate With Team Members in Docsie

### 

Docsie simplifies cross-channel publishing by improving consistency, ease of use, and scalability for large documentation libraries. Docsie also supports collaboration to help your team orchestrate their documentation management workflows.



### Docsie Internal and External Collaborators

Documentation needs to be written before it can be published. This could include internal writing staff or external collaborators paid per project to write documentation. Docsie caters to all of the above, allowing businesses to create Teams and manage people and content simultaneously.

Internal staff can be added to a Team manually by an Owner or Admin, through group policy using Docsie role-based access controls (RBAC), or request access to join a Team group.

External collaborators can be invited to a Team via email within the Docsie portal, making onboarding for contractors fast and efficient.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/axkzsfrdmsdknhqnccqj)



### Docsie Team Chat

Instead of email or Slack, businesses can use Docsie Team Chat. This centralizes communications related to your documentation to improve focus, while facilitating instant messaging (IM) for faster team responses. Team members will receive message notifications in the Docsie portal or via email – ensuring nobody misses any crucial pieces of information.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/sqjnonxdlqfjcmhuwwhe)



### Docsie Permissions and User Management

Docsie uses a role-based access control (RBAC) framework – sometimes referred to as identity access management (IAM) -  to control user permissions for documentation access. Each user can be designated as an Owner, Admin, Editor, and Viewer to enable granular control over access, data governance, and security – contained under the umbrella of governance risk compliance (GRC).

5/4/2021 15:59:26,Tal F.,"At Docsie, we bring the power of versatile documentation tools to you. Companies can innovate in the central process of delivering information to every stakeholder in a very particular way – so that new initiatives and products get the visibility that they need, and everyone is on the same page.



Organization And Visual Dashboard Designs



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_ZyQQgNoRzIf0AZalw/boo_6i8Nk6EIN6esFJcNT/807c72cb-8b02-9d4a-f090-398beacaaf8b11.png)

The Docsie platform works on the principle of pushing product documentation and content to its end user environments in a centralized and organized way. So much of today's software development world is built around this kind of visual dashboard approach, where it's the format and the intuitive interface that matter most.



With a great cloud hosted interface, it's easy to unify your product documentation, tackle the learning curve, and publish your content to the web – seamlessly and effortlessly. That cloud model is very useful – that’s why cloud services took over twenty-first century business so fully and quickly. But it has to be set up right!



Virtual Books and Virtual Shelves



Here's another component of that virtual organization that drives [Docsie’s](https://www.docsie.io/) product documentation processes.



Within our interface, you'll see [virtual shelves holding discrete numbers of virtual books](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/using-docsie-library/moving-and-copying-documents/) that contain your content and documentation, and the tools to move items with key automations.



This [object-driven mentality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300921) is part of how we help our clients to onboard staff quickly and efficiently, with the system that everyone can learn to use confidently. You could think of it as the “Github for documentation” – in many ways, it’s that same process of building a context for information that is popular, easy to understand, and then universally adopted. 



Collaborative Tools



In any content process, there are usually multiple stakeholders – people and parties working together to get the right information to the right destination.



That's also a huge part of [how ](https://www.docsie.io/beta/)[Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/beta/)[ works](https://www.docsie.io/beta/), and how we have thoughtfully designed the platform to deliver. Through the documentation workflow processes in our model, it becomes easier to see what each participant is doing within a collaborative pipeline.



Publishing Automations Make Content Portable



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_FgD6fHcnzlU0hpYDT/boo_6i8Nk6EIN6esFJcNT/8e4935e4-2227-8d61-3946-fa3c1acf78394.png)

Essentially, the[ JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) automations that we built Docsie on are an example of how API documentation tools and related resources work to allow clients to publish anywhere, instead of being confined to one isolated Wordpress silo or other shuttered destination. That versatility is at the core of how a unified documentation and content system releases its goods to the world – how you move things from drafts or beta into the full production phase.



Want to learn more about Docsie? Try one of our demos, or reach out to a friendly technician to get more information on what this type of platform can do for your business. You’ll see that principle of transparency and frictionless documentation workflows at work, helping adopters to drive efficiencies and outpace the competition.

So you finally decided to write a new user guide about your amazing product.

What one comes to realize in 2021, is that creating a user guide is still mostly a manual process. You get the next best app to create your user guide and start putting together the content. 

So how do you start, why do you start, why do you even need a user guide (duh...)? I will attempt to answer some of the common questions about user guide creation as well as guide you to help you with creating your first user guide in Docsie, but you can literally use any other tool... 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_lqOAjT8rVqHqh8oj8/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/4291e8d4-6bd3-9c95-761d-7a53b35c66711_(1).png)



## Reasons and Benefits to create a user guide

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_iZzj1WY3nNoP7oCen/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/61ddfa77-6229-1511-c6b1-c77b1d40b8069.png)

There are many reasons to create user guides. User guides are extremely useful and play a crucial role in the world of consumers, electronics, software programs and all facets of tangible or intangible products. User guides provide your users with simple, step by step instructions on how to use and/or assemble the products.

Your customers need to be educated on the products that you are selling, services you are providing or methods and procedures that they must follow. They offer a step-by-step process in which your customers can learn how to use, and educate themselves on your product's different features and functions.

### Creating proper user guides limits the legal liability of products:

User guides also limit liabilities of incorrect use of your products. A user guide is very handy for products that may cause potential injuries or even death as a result of not properly using or assembling the product. For example: high-voltage devices, fire generating devises and even lasers require extensive manuals to protect the customer from improper use.

### Creating good user guides save time:

Good quality user manuals share instructions on how-to-use your products which can save a lot of time to your technical team explaining things or sales teams doing demos. A lot of complicated software products require good technical user guides to help their customers learn how to use their products with the highest potential. Software’s are normally bombarded by many features and having the right amount of user guides to fuel the customer with useful information’s can help in the long run to retain customers and save time on explaining how various aspects of the software and complicated products are to be used.

### Educating your customers on your products uses:

Educating customers on technical products is very important. Without proper user guides your customers can be confused by a barrage of hidden features and not know how to use the full potential of the technical product. User guides allow for an easy process in which your customers can learn to engage in the various technical aspects of your product and feel comfortable for having a user guide handy when they need to delve deeper into your products. It will take the stress away from them trying to figure things out without formal written guidance. Also for dangerous-to-use products, user guides can provide warnings against misusing products in a dangerous manner.



## What makes a great user guide

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_jripxf4mYymO4f3xy/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/fe45270c-c55d-dab5-f45c-363cc455ecb821.png)



So to start making a user guide you need to understand what problem you are trying to help solve for a specific customer. Making a user guide for everything about everything turns it into an incomprehensible mess that no one will understand including it's target audience. If you look at some of the best examples of user guides online, written by superstar companies like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/payments?payments=popular) or [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/categories/200111606-Using-Slack). You will notice a particular pattern. 



> Each user guide focuses on solving a particular problem. 



So what should each guide do? It should focus on simple actions that your user can accomplish while following this guide. There is no need from complication. On the contrary, if you focus on addressing common simple action that helps your users solve common simple problems with your product, you will arrive at having a set of amazing user guides that your customers will love.



So let's look closely into a few users guides to understand what is a structure of an amazing user guide so we can take that as a reference point on how we can write an amazing user guide ourselves.

Let's look into the the Managing Book guide above and come up with a few points of 



































## Organizing your user guides



**Using Docsie to create user guides**

Docsie has various tools and features that allows you to make awesome user guides. Firstly, lets take a look at how Docsie works. Docsie works under the premise of books and shelves and collections.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_8ASkXMSmGFUkhL3h8/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/e263c093-0b3e-b83b-bd9a-38f6cc305cb21.png)

The collections are used to isolate various books you want to show different type of customers. For example this collection is used to show Business Users only. This means that we selected only 3 books from the all of the books created to show these specific customers.

Once you are on Docsies Collection tool bar you can create the name of your collection and also pick what user guides you want in this specific collection. The reason why this is important is because different customers may need to know different user guides of your products and this tool allows you to only show the specific user guides they need to see.

Now lets get started on writing your first user guide with Docsie, this is done with Docsies “Book”

Think of a book as your user guide or manual. Within your opened book you will see the Editor, a place to create 'Articles' and Headers.

The editor on top, the ability to create various version and languages on the top left corner and of course “Articles and subheading sections to the left.

The editor is simple to use, it allows you to add videos, pictures and code with our simple to use drag and drop process.  Also it allows you to stylize your contect as you see fit.

Articles are really easy to create; just type in your title. In this case the type is “What is Docsie” but you can type in whatever you desire for the title of your User Guide.

To create subsections in your user guides which will appear as 1.1,1.2..ext all you need to do is select the location of your text and set the text as ‘Header” this is done by clicking the H in the editor tab.





![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_OCwuils7ezubiAv8a/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/1dd88460-f856-79c7-96a9-e43c31fd5f217.png)

Docsie also allows you to create various version and languages of your user guides. This is very useful and handy for localization and to talk about various alterations of your product user guides.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_vJFG764JBiJeDM4fU/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/a160f3ac-da2e-37bc-7133-a0172707c2828.png)

Once you have prepared your user guides, wrote them out, stylized them with photos which helped explain the various aspects of your products and features the next step is publishing.





## To summarize, here are the Tips and Tricks for Creating a User Guide

Most software and technical products are very complex and multi-faceted. To address this issue in creating a user guide for complex products it is a good idea to break the information and instruction down into smaller parts. Essentially creating various small user guides and compiling them into a user guide manual set-up



Your customers are not familiar with your product and or service. The more technical your product the more descriptive your user guides should be in the creation stage. Vague words and phraseology will not be your friend in this process. Be as specific as possible so that your customer can comprehend even the more remedial aspects of your product.



A picture is worth more than one thousand words. This is true, especially or user guides and manuals. This step is highly neglected by most companies, but having the right photos or snapshots of your product features and aspects of your product while explaining them on your user guides is very important. That way your customer can understand what aspects of your product you are referring to.

Your user guides are designed to help your customers understand the various uses of your products. Explain things in as simple a manner as possible so that they can understand their various features and aspects easily.

5/4/2021 16:08:10,Tal F,"**From Paper to Pixels**

Only a few decades ago, it seemed every business was using paper for documentation. Contracts, policies, meeting notes; everything was paper-based - being printed and passed around instead of attached and analyzed via email.

As technology became more advanced, businesses had more storage space for documentation, and the computer systems needed for employees to access these digital documents. This marks the start of a transition away from paper to pixels.

The modern world of digital documentation offers numerous benefits, but problems persist. Documentation is used to convey information, both to internal staff and external customers. This means that consistency of content, ease of access, and ease of management are essential. Contrarily, inconsistent, inaccessible and unmanageable digital documentation can reduce your businesses ability to effectively convey information.

To drive ease and consistency, enterprises should follow digital documentation best-practices. This encompasses the design, formatting, choice of file types, and governance of digital documentation.

In this eBook, we will discuss best-practices for digital documentation and the potential business impact of making these changes. Can better digital documentation drive revenue growth and attract customers? How can businesses transform their digital documentation to deliver better value to customers using a documentation management system, or DMS?

Let us answer these questions!

Digital Documentation Benefits
==============================

Before we discuss the what and how of digital documentation best-practices, first we should understand the benefits of digital documentation:

- **Ease of Management** -- Digital documentation is easier to manage than paper documents. Paper documentation requires space in the office for a filing cabinet, and requires manual archiving for each paper document. Digital document storage frees up office real estate, and simplifies management with search functionality and folder structures.

As detailed in this Software Advice study, office workers spend an average of six hours per week searching for paper documents. Additionally, office workers spend an average of eight hours per week creating reports from paper documents, with 94% saying that a document management system (DMS) makes this process easier.[[1]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn1)

- **Ease of Access** - These digital documents can also be shared, virtually in real-time, via email or cloud storage. This negates the need for posting letters, eliminating postage or courier costs. It also increases the speed of response, as recipients no longer need to wait days for a letter to arrive. Furthermore, digital documentation can be deployed on your website or social media, improving ease of access for customers.

Did you know that - according to Gartner - for every $1 spent on printing documents, another $6 is spent on handling and distributing these documents? Furthermore, half of all printed documents are thrown away within 24 hours.[[2]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn2)

- **Security and Governance** -- Unless its hidden behind a lock and key, paper documentation is insecure. Anyone can read it, make a copy, and share as they see fit. Contrarily, digital documentation can be governed by role-based access controls (RBAC) to grant access only to those who need it.

Even Governments are not immune to paper data breaches, with the US Department for Veterans Affairs attributing paper documentation as the reason for 98% of data breaches[[3]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn3).

- **Environmental Benefits** -- People and businesses alike are searching for ways to reduce their environmental footprint. Digital documentation is one route they can take. According to Green America, paper consumption has risen by 400% in the last 40 years, with the industry accounting for 4% of global energy consumption[[4]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn4). By opting for digital documentation, businesses can reduce their paper usage to combat deforestation -- keeping trees alive to absorb carbon emissions and sustain animal habitats.

**Best-Practices With Digital Documentation on Docsie**

Digital documentation has the capacity to transform knowledge sharing, publishing, and marketing across the business. To tap into this potential, businesses should follow digital documentation best-practices:

Align Your DMS With Business Needs
----------------------------------

A document management system (DMS) is the foundation that helps businesses store and manage their documentation. After content is written, it is uploaded to a DMS for storage and distribution. A DMS centralizes documentation storage, providing a single source of knowledge for the entire business. This functions much like a digital library, categorizing documents by department or product, with search functionality to streamline knowledge sharing. From here, marketing and support teams can share documentation, publishing it on websites and social media, or in response to customer queries.

Docsie is a DMS that simplifies the way your team does docs. Every business needs a way to store and share documentation, both so internal staff can learn about their job role, and customers can learn how to use your product or service. HR onboarding documents, product how-to guides, sales communication templates -- all of these items can be stored and published with the right DMS solution.

What documentation currently exists on your products and services? Do your staff use templates and frameworks when communicating with customers? Can you easily store, internally share, and externally publish your documentation? Ask these questions when considering a DMS solution like Docsie, and ensure that your DMS is aligned with business needs.

Focus on Compatibility
----------------------

Digital documentation can increase accessibility, but only when using highly-compatible file formats. This is important with downloadable documentation, as certain customers may be unable to open a file. It also applies to internal documentation, where one employee using PDF and another using DOCX may cause file format fragmentation -- prompting other employees to switch software packages, or convert to another format to make the file accessible.

Open file formats like docx, xlsx, and pptx for Microsoft Office, or the open document format (ODF) for OpenOffice are ideal for maximizing compatibility. Adobe PDF documents are common, but less compatible due to requiring a PDF viewer. Consider who will be accessing these documents, and store documentation in a format that caters to the widest possible user base.

Docsie is a great option for broad document compatibility. When text is loaded into the Docsie Book Editor, it is stored in the open-source JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format. You can find more information on exporting documents, and how Docsie enables easy conversion into DOC, PDF, Markdown (MD) and HTML formats [here](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/docsie-editor/exporting-content/).

Actionable Feedback
-------------------

User and employee feedback on documentation is vital. If documentation lacks information, contains incorrect information, or is simply hard to read -- readers will struggle to get any value from your documentation. Furthermore, feedback can help you improve existing documentation to provide more value to customers, driving business success through quality knowledge sharing.

Docsie Vocally is an all-in-one feedback monitoring and response service. It allows readers to rank individual pieces of documentation on a scale of one to five, with comments to explain the reasons for their rating. Docsie Owners and Admins can read this feedback, gaining insight into the success and shortcomings of your documentation.

Self-service knowledge bases are designed to minimize support requirements, but this also means that customers are unlikely to persist with bad documentation -- instead searching for an alternative with competitors who provide better documentation. To tackle this problem, Docise Vocally will record user interactions as they read your documentation. This will highlight where they encountered a problem in a document, and what content is causing the problem. Writers can use this feedback to edit documentation and act on user feedback. Over time, this will improve the quality of documentation knowledge, empowering customers to help themselves.

Customer empowerment is a great way to attract new business, reduce costs, and retain customers. Around 67% of customers prefer self-service to speaking over the phone, according to Zendesk[[5]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn5). Forrester Research and Oracle also found that self-service can drive down support costs by $11 per call[[6]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn6). Finally, a study from Microsoft highlights how 90% of customers expect a self-service option[[7]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn7).

Summarily, customers prefer and expect quality self-service, and providing this option can significantly reduce support costs. By creating a self-service knowledge base in Docsie, and improving documentation quality with feedback through Docsie Vocally - you can cater to evolving customer demands through digital documentation.

**Document Versioning**

Particularly with technology companies, new software or service versions can introduce problems with documentation. The new version may include different workflows to previous versions, or different terminology that may confuse users. Concurrently, new documentation may not apply to older versions of your services, creating knowledge gaps that have the potential to frustrate and drive away customers.

This is an important best-practice with digital documentation. Customers may need older versions of your software for compatibility with their hardware, or simply choose to not update to a new version. Thus, businesses should always cater to their user base regardless of the version number being used.

Docsie tackles this problem with document versioning. When you update a document in Docsie, you can retain previous versions for redundancy purposes. Customers on version 2 of your service can select the right documentation, with customers on version 1 still having access to older documentation. This is called fragmentation; when your customer base is split across multiple versions of the same software. Docsie reduces the impact of fragmentation, ensuring knowledge is available no matter the version being used.

Document versioning ensures the right information is available when needed. It also helps with traceability, especially when multiple writers are working on the same piece of content. Versioning also reduces duplication, consolidating your documentation for ease of access.

Does your business regularly update its documentation? Are your customers struggling to find the right information for current and historic versions of your software and services? If so, it may be time to apply the best-practice of document versioning through a DMS like Docsie. You can find more information on Docise document versioning [here](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/docsie-editor/managing-versions/).

Workforce Documentation Habits
------------------------------

Your people create documentation, but they can also create problems with documentation. During the draft phase, writers may use different font sizes or types, or outdated iconography and artwork. These differences are easy to miss for employees that work with content every day, but customers are more likely to notice. The result is inconsistent documentation, driven by inconsistencies in the approach to content creation and publishing across your workforce.

Docsie helps businesses tackle content inconsistency with the Docsie Documentation Hub. You can set a default font type and size, add company logos or artwork, and define CSS style sheet parameters for use on a company website or knowledge base. These choices will propagate from Docsie to any web page with Docsie embedded content, using the same colors, fonts and logos everywhere your content is published.

This simplifies content management and publishing workflows. Rather than editing individual pages, businesses can set a content design framework once in Docsie and apply those changes everywhere. This is known as centralized management or orchestration. The process of editing each document or page individually may seem doable for smaller content libraries, but this process will not scale efficiently as the library grows in breadth and depth.

In summary, Docsie works to futureproof your content management workflows by minimizing low-level administrative workloads. By starting with scale in mind, large content libraries can be managed with simplicity - setting content design frameworks once and deploying everywhere with Docsie. You can find out more about Docsie Customized Documentation Hubs using the Docsie Manager [here](https://www.docsie.io/docsie_manager/).

Centralized Documentation Storage
---------------------------------

On the topic of centralization, document storage locations can help or hinder management and publishing workflows. You may store documentation on an intranet or SharePoint site, in Dropbox or Google Drive, and on-premise or cloud storage partitions. Each option here works in isolation, but can cause chaos when used simultaneously.

An employee needs access to a document. The document is stored on a SharePoint site. The employee downloads it and saves it to their account storage partition. A business file synchronization tool uploads this to the cloud automatically. The employee sends the document via Slack to a colleague. That's four copies of the same document in circulation on your IT network, with decentralization across four different services or tools.

Docsie tackles this decentralized chaos by centralizing documents in a single storage location. When you upload a document, Docsie places the document on a shelf. We refer to documents as books, with each shelf filling up with books to form a content library. Employees can log into Docsie to find all of your documentation, with filtering that delivers relevant documentation by department or seniority using role-based access controls (RBAC). From here, employees can publish documents directly to your website, edit documentation text, check different versions, and view feedback from customers or colleagues.

Now, when an employee needs access to a document, all they have to do is open Docsie. They can search for documents, export in common file formats, and share direct links to Docsie books or shelves. For external users, they can be invited by Owners and Admins for direct access to authorized Docsie books and shelves, without compromising on security. It's like folders and files on a hard drive, but with a little Docsie magic! You can find out more about Docsie shelves and books [here](https://www.docsie.io/features/).

Document Governance Risk and Compliance
---------------------------------------

Most documentation will be created for the public domain. Still, some documentation may be confidential. This presents the need for governance risk and compliance (GRC) management. GRC policies can be used to govern access to confidential documents, control document permissions for writers and readers, and prevent accidental publication of documentation in the draft phase.

Docsie uses role-based access controls (RBAC) to govern permissions on the platform. This is how Docsie helps businesses manage GRC workflows, by defining user roles and assigning permissions based on seniority or department. These roles include Viewer, Editor, Admin, and Owner. Viewers are granted read-only access to documents, with editors being granted read and write permissions. Admins can assign roles to manage who is allowed to read, write or both per book or per shelf. The Owner can manage every user and document in a Docsie organization, and is the only user role that can delete an entire organization. In this example, the organization could be Docsie, with shelves containing books on different functionalities in Docsie.

In conclusion, GRC is important for managing access to documentation. With too little access, employees will be unable to work on documentation. With too much access, employees may accidentally publish unfinished documentation, or gain access to confidential documents that are reserved for executives and managers. Docsie helps you strike a balance between access and security, making the platform suitable for storing any type of document.

This document is sensitive, how can I prevent unauthorized access? How can I give my team write permissions, while only giving other teams read-only access? A freelance writer needs permission to edit this document, how can I do that? If your business is asking these questions, Docsie has the answers! You can find more information on Docsie permissions management [here](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/workspace-administration/managing-and-understanding-permissions/).

Team Collaboration
------------------

Content is rarely crafted by a single person. When multiple writers are working on your documentation library, collaboration is critical.

What processes do your employees follow when working on documentation? An example would be searching on a network drive for existing documents and downloading to a computer. Next, the writer may send a final draft via email to a colleague for further proofing. The approved draft may then be uploaded to a content management system (CMS) ready for publishing. Later in the day, someone notices a problem and sends an annotated version back to the writer via Slack. This workflow may work, but it can be simplified.

Docsie reduces the number of tools you need with comprehensive team collaboration functionality. You can find documents in Docsie, write and edit, share changes with team members, chat and annotate, and publish to the internet without ever leaving the Docsie dashboard. This negates the need for downloading, uploading, emailing, and managing a CMS -- allowing you to simply manage your docs with Docsie! Team members can be tagged using @mention, chat conversations are isolated to each Docsie book, and external freelancers can be invited with ease for full team collaboration in any location.

By minimizing the number of tools required, employees can focus on creating content instead of switching between software. This expedites content creation workflows by minimizing wasted clicks, with comments and suggestions from colleagues being easily accessible in the right-hand toolbar. No more link sharing, no more outdated versions of documents, no more lost emails or chat messages -- everything to do with your docs is centralized in Docsie.

Imagine if you can take all of the valuable information that’s scattered across your enterprise in emails, physical folders, shared drives and more, and put it into one easily, accessible location. And then, allow your employees and customers to leverage all of that information to their benefit.

At its most basic level, a knowledge base is a digital library of carefully curated information that can be stored, organized, searched, modified and shared. When viewed in the context of enterprise infrastructure, it’s the epicenter of all of your enterprise’s knowledge and one of the most frequent ways your stakeholders will experience or interact with your enterprise.

There is no question that in today’s world, enterprises that want to function efficiently need a knowledge base. You just need to know what type of knowledge base you need and how to create it.



### What Type of Knowledge Base Does Your Enterprise Need?

**Employee Knowledge Base**

An internal knowledge base consolidates enterprise knowledge and the collective know-how of employees. It is a must-have if you want your employees to have access to the information that can help them do their jobs as seamlessly as possible. You can include any sort of information that has to be shared within your enterprise, such as:

* Employee handbook

* Product catalog

* Best practices

* HR policies

* Onboarding training for new employees

The knowledge base should also promote collaboration between your employees, giving them the capability to pose questions and provide answers to one another.  

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/smkjimvctbbblpexslsg)

Why is this so important? There is no enterprise that doesn’t benefit from its employees being more productive and more engaged.



**Customer Knowledge Base**

You have to let your customers help themselves. Why? Because they want to. According to Gartner, [70% of customers](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/rethink-customer-service-strategy-drive-self-service/) use a self-service channel at some time in their journey to a resolution. 

Any content that can help customers understand and use your service or product should be included. This includes, but is not limited to:

* How-to articles

* FAQ sections

* Glossaries

* Case studies

* Video tutorials

* White papers 

An external or customer-facing knowledge base will not solve *every* issue your customers may have with your service or product, just the most common ones. So, whenever you begin to get the same question repeatedly from customers, save your customers and employees a lot of time and just put the answer in the knowledge base. 

**Why Not Both?**

You may find that your enterprise will benefit most from a knowledge base that is a combination of the two. Of course, you wouldn’t want all of the information on the knowledge base to be accessible to all users. 

For example, do your customers really need to know about how your enterprise’s HR policies for addressing tardy workers? Even within the information posted for just employees, it may be necessary to limit some employees’ access to certain parts of the knowledge base due to their job title or the department they work in. If you are working with the [right documentation platform](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/), this will be no problem because you’ll be able to manage access to certain information by applying user [permissions](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/workspace-administration/managing-and-understanding-permissions/).

 

### Factors to Consider When Creating Your Knowledge Base

Creating the knowledge base your enterprise needs isn’t just something you can throw together, post online and expect to function as it should. It takes a bit of reflection, planning and *the right tools* to get it right. Take a look at some of the factors you should consider when developing a knowledge base.** **

**Enterprise Issues That Would Be Solved By a Knowledge Base.** Do your customers seem to ask the very same questions repeatedly, affecting employee productivity and customer satisfaction goals? Do your employees find it difficult to do their job because they have to search multiple places to locate the information they need?

**The Core Content Elements of Your Knowledge Base. **You should conduct a full content audit to determine exactly what type of content is floating around your enterprise, if the information is still accurate and what information is missing. And remember, the content will not make the impact you want if it's not in its best form, no matter how valuable the content is.

**Organization and Structure of Topics and Articles. **A knowledge base should be structured in a logical way and be consistent so that it is easy to navigate. Look to your brand so that the information your post into the knowledge base has the [same tone and visuals](https://www.docsie.io/documentation/styling_guide/). 

**Metrics to Determine the Success of Your Knowledge Base. **How else can you be sure that your knowledge base is doing what it is supposed to do? The metrics that you will use can vary, depending on the purpose of the knowledge base, but here are some examples want you may want to monitor:

* Search activity, including search keywords

* Content performance based on type, ratings, visits and page views

* [Real-time actions of customers](https://www.docsie.io/gather_feedback/) on the knowledge base** **

**The Right Software to Create and Manage Your Knowledge Base. **The documentation platform you use to develop your knowledge base should be able to scale along with your enterprise. It should have the functionalities to incorporate the features you want in your knowledge base. Let's take a brief look at [Docsie](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/).

### Using Docsie to Create and Customize Your Knowledge Base

Docsie is a dynamic documentation platform that unifies documentation creation, content management, and content integration into one seamless platform, making it easy for you to create and maintain a knowledge base. Look at how easy it can be: 

* We mentioned earlier that collaboration should be a key function of an internal knowledge base. Docsie, provides a [built-in chat function](https://www.docsie.io/markdown_editor/) in its editor to encourage and improve collaboration between teams.

* If your target audience is global, you can have your knowledge base content [translated automatically](https://www.docsie.io/self-writing-documentation/).

* This is how easy it is to [publish](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/publish-documentation-portal/): simply use one line of code to publish your knowledge base documentation to your enterprise website or app. That’s it. Really.

* Remember how we said that you should be able to analyze how your users interact with the knowledge base? With Docsie, you can also receive insights based on predictive documentation AI to enhance your documents to improve those interactions.

If you create an optimal knowledge base, your employees and customers will know that you have valuable information and that you believe that their access to that information is a priority. The knowledge base will serve as one of the faces of your enterprise, so it is worthwhile taking the effort and using the right software to ensure that it works.

5/4/2021 16:12:56,Tal F.,"######  How leading organizations gain a competitive advantage by keeping their training manuals plain, succinct, and highly successful.

Are you in charge of educating and training your coworkers, clients, or new hires? If that's the case, keep reading.

It can be difficult to share and educate others. Especially if you don't have a good example for a training manual template to get you started quickly. In this article, I'll show you how to increase productivity and decrease downtime by using Docsie to create a simple training manual template and sharing it with your team.

## Step 1: Create an account with Docsie (it's free). 

## 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_wX9JoNbS1HNZqB1vU/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/964e0589-ee96-b0fb-6fdd-d760b5e81f53image.png)

Docsie is a simple training manual development tool that provides companies with reusable templates to help them develop better training manuals. To get started, it's completely free, and you can build your first training manual in under 10 minutes. Once you are signed up we can begin to explain how to write a training manual through Docsie.



## Step 2: Create a book to make an awesome basic training manual template.

Docsie is based on the concept of books and shelves, with books serving essentially as instructional manuals and shelves serving as departments and knowledge base hubs.

Assume you're a busy sales team with a need to have all of your outbound training materials in one place. You may use Docsie to organize and categorize your training manuals using sets. You can then invite the rest of the training team to collaborate and build better training manuals together once you're ready.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_qd5uDhTnzIv7i7usI/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/eeee9ae3-949a-4a68-ff86-1774bdad3340image.png)

## Step 3 - Define training instructions

This is where you'll identify the training categories and pathways you'll need to create to order to educate your target audience.

Keep in mind that this guide assumes that you already know who your target audience is; this guide's aim is to show you how to easily build content for your instructional training manual.

Consider a sales force. It has beginner and advanced sales tracks for a variety of positions, including SDRs (Sales Growth Representatives), Account Executives, Customer Success Representatives, and so on. The positions can have different names and responsibilities depending on the nature of your sales company, but they all require training manuals and a traceable way to share information.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_G26esoODDFXA7gBlw/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/0bbdb8bd-8fa4-5057-8bb2-4816e06b647aimage.png)

As a result, once you've identified your training tracks, you can start interviewing experts in those positions to help you determine the content for those tracks. As an example, you could interview an account executive to learn more about how they work.

Once you know their everyday routine, practices and duties you'll construct a process diagram that details the tasks of that specific job, giving you a clear picture of those responsibilities.

You'll then break down those duties into actionable steps by stage/seniority, which will make creating a training manual a breeze because you will know what and how to write a manual for your specific team.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_h2VzPUoPrfLAgyWSZ/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/426f2d7b-d360-d8d2-3042-01b6797217c2image.png)

Once you have completed gathering enough information, you can use it to develop your training material using a training manual template.



## Step 4: Develop training materials

Following the outline and road map you drew up for yourself in the previous steps, and armed with the information gathered from your team. You will begin to fill your training and instruction manual template prototype with content, stage by stage, gradually expanding each stage to help your trainees develop a proper training base.


Different articles can devise different steps in Docsie to illustrates in training manuals. There are many great tools that work together with Docsie to help you easily build amazing manuals.

## Step 5 - Publish your training manual and share it with your team

You must want to share your training material with your new trainees and/or customers now that you've developed it in Docsie. It's as easy as clicking publish and having it appear on a Docsie embedded page on your site.

If you want to limit access to all of your training material, you can do so easily in Docsie. You can also allocate a unique password to a particular trainee and revoke access at any time.

With only one line of code, you can also insert your training material directly into your company's intranet using Docsie.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_SReYm8UdA6cJ9A6PX/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/0323cf4c-d72e-5b5c-5e0f-fcf03d027ce4image.png)



## Step 6: Collect feedback on your training manual and update it on Docsie.

Once you've released your training manual prototype, you're ready to go. You may want to learn how your trainees and/or customers communicate with your training manual and give them the chance to provide you with actionable feedback so you can better your job.

This is where you can use Vocally (a Docsie Extension) to collect video clips of your trainees' training experiences to better understand how they deal with your instruction manual template. You may also give them the option of providing input on their training experience, which will be categorized in Vocally manager.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_OqJHxdveDITl5by25/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/0a5ecb60-0b4b-1bf9-f1c6-d9a0a1357ca5image.png)

You can then use Vocally Manager, which is easily incorporated with your project monitoring software, to build actionable tasks for yourself to update and refine how you write a manual based on user feedback.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_TCiT6UQygjeRreFqY/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/b0696bf6-153e-b42a-4933-97fd097dd59eimage.png)

## Step 7: Maintain and translate the material of your training manual.

You can now translate your instructional manual templates into multiple languages right on Docsie, and you can even communicate with experienced content translators who can help you update your content at a discounted rate.

Furthermore, creating new versions of your training materials in Docsie is as easy as clicking a button as your training materials grow. As a result, you will not lose any more valuable training copies and will still have a point of reference to refer to.



## Final Thoughts

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543386650-2be9a18d2750?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGZpbmFsJTIwdGhvdWdodHN8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjIwMTU3MTg3&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

Docsie can be used if you are serious about making excellent training manuals and use instructional manual templates. It will significantly simplify and improve the workflow of your training manual.

Instructional manual templates play an important role in employee training by informing new employees about the organization and its procedures. Employees are maturing and learning new technologies, techniques, and processes.

Employees who aren't actively learning or who aren't knowledgeable about the devices, applications, equipment, or machinery used by their company may become disengaged at work.

However, disengagement often leads to high employee turnover and poor work satisfaction. In the end, both the employers and employees suffer losses.



Not to mention, there are statistics to back this up:



Within a year, 40% of workers with inadequate training quit their jobs.

Because of a lack of growth opportunities, 74 percent of workers feel they are not reaching their full potential at work.

Employees consider contributing financially to training in 72 percent of cases.



According to 68 percent of employees, the company's most important agenda is growth and training.

Just 13% of workers worldwide are engaged.



Employee disengagement costs the economy more than $500 billion each year.

The numbers, on the other hand, are endless. The problem is real. Employees want to grow and improve their skills in both traditional training and developmental opportunities.



A great way for businesses to get started on this much-needed method is to create a fantastic company training guide or training manual.



We need to get down to the point and figure out what the most important aspects of a fantastic training manual would be and how to write a manual.



In 2017, 45 percent of learning hours in a typical company were created by online or even e-learning methods, according to the ATD (Association-for-Talent-Development-in-the-United-States). In comparison to 2015, this represents a 42 percent increase.



The ability to develop an instruction manual template is a natural skill that is necessary for business continuity and growth.

Hi Everyone!

On my last video I spoke about how to create product documentation and edit your product documentation. Also I showed you how to embed videos, pictures, media as well as code so that you can create product documentation so that you can further educate your customers about your technical platforms and solutions.

Now I wanted to take a deep dive in Docsie product documentation platform and show you how to create software documentation simple and easily.

Here is a quick tutorial on how to explain how to publish with Docsie.

Publishing with Docsie’s knowledge portal can be done in a few ways. In this video I explain how to publish with Docsie’s knowledge portals, books, shelves or articles with one simple line of code.

In this example I wanted to publish this specific book called 'Writing your first Django app, part 2'



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_vghRPvDGV9FcXW5sq/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/8baf35b2-88ce-eb21-1eca-e13454c076beimage.png)



As you can see in my current already created software documentation I have written a version called 'Brand new portal that I am working on"" and if you click on the 'pencil' tool near it you have the option of making your published portal 'active' or 'primary' or turning these features off. which is awesome because that means you and your team can write your or update your documentation and not have it visible to your customers or clients until you are ready to have it published your created product documentation in production on your website:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Wpue5g2itHdkeHQWH/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/e1957632-a49c-efea-8206-7ea31886a8dcimage.png)

That that I you are ready to publish its time to deploy your documentation!  This is done easily by first clicking on the three dots at the top right corner of the Docsie platform, and then clicking on your account:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Vyh10Vht9p5HgACri/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/cc784b29-8edd-ade4-807c-cb6a30b61998image.png)

Once you are on your Profile and settings page,  click the tab entitled ""Deployments'. this will bring you to the deployment page and help you get set up on creating your embedder code that will be placed upon your website.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_FOdT3hJo8ygjq6lYH/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/ed142930-2a7b-b56c-0ccf-3183c6191179image.png)

Now click ""Configure a new deployment +"" 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_vbyck51UPHrWOVomu/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/c3affc72-9cdd-b8ee-4c51-5798f54e5688image.png)



Great! Now that you have access to the dashboard all you need to do is deploy a custom domain this is done easy by opening the ""Deploy a domain: tab bar and clicking 'custom deployment'

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Xlx7uCVpKiy3TJbaI/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/30f5281a-702a-9bd4-a926-9440f1aaef22image.png)

Now the next two steps are simple: 

1. The first step is to type in your domain (and remember to use http:// or https:// before writing your domain name)

2. the second step is to pick what you want to publish, you have the choice to publish, a Book or an entire Shelf. In this example I am publishing a book entailed: 'Writing your first Django app, part 2'



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Tac6kZ9pjFovGo8Ut/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/2d5ad6d7-27fc-c487-f6bc-b97d7f1be44aimage.png)

Great! Now the last step is before getting our code is to click ""+More Options""



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_OrYP2ugvhlurWxfbJ/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/390a98c1-f554-9ae3-7e09-8faed42d93a2image.png)



Now you can use our various plugins, features and other documentation options to spice up your knowledge portal and make it more handy for your users. These features,  plugins and  product documentation tools are quite nifty and make your knowledge portals more robust.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Wy76iK9zPT84NoPdu/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/ed41417e-41dc-cffc-161a-4ffa182d3796image.png)

note: you can change these additional features and plugins and other product documentation tools any time. 

Once that's done click 'Create web portal'.

Now scroll down to the bottom and click ""+ Get deployment script""



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Lv7JtNkP26EPzxBTw/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/6196219b-ddb3-55b8-d15f-3b08276ebbc2image.png)

And copy your script and paste it into your HTML:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_C7q3zLB0gXrf4HObS/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/550abafc-23f2-e1f3-138a-7435eca30e4fimage.png)

7/2/2021 11:35:48,Ciaran Sweet,"Product teams and software teams both share a common bugbear: documentation.

Product documentation refers to user-facing manuals and guides which explain the workflow and user interface of a product. How can the average user be productive with this product? In this sense, product documentation could be used for software products.

Software documentation refers to the underlying technologies, prerequisites, and configurable attributes of a software product. How do IT administrators configure, monitor, host, and deploy the software product for users? This type of documentation is important, especially when multiple versions or branches are added into the mix.

In a sense, product documentation is like teaching someone how to drive a car. The wheel turns the car, the accelerator pedal moves the car, the brake pedal stops the car. Software documentation teaches someone how the car works. The wheel is connected to the front axle which turns the front tires to alter the course of travel; the accelerator increases airflow to the engine which draws in more fuel, generating torque and horsepower.

Both documentation types are important. One educates users, and one educates administrators and developers. It’s great showing people how to drive a car, but if nobody knows how the car works, what happens when the car breaks down?

## Minor Differences Between Product and Software Documentation

There are minor differences to be aware of with product and software documentation:

### Software and Product Documentation: Target Audience and Persona

Product documentation caters to a single audience; the user. It assumes the user has no technical knowledge, communicating in plain English with minimal jargon. Much like a technical apprenticeship versus a university degree, it educates people on how to do things, with less focus on theoretical or conceptual knowledge.

Software documentation is targeted to IT administrators, engineers, and developers. It covers the design and architecture of software, command line setup instructions, API and integration support, data management and reporting, network topology – basically the cogs that make the machine work. These documents form a single-source-of-truth (SSOT) that IT personnel can refer to when monitoring and troubleshooting the software application.

### Software and Product Documentation: Update Frequencies

Software documentation must be consistently updated as new commits are merged into the main release channel. The software documentation must highlight new functions and commands, and deprecate old features. New or changing dependencies should be documented, and feature support across all target platforms should be clarified – such as one feature working on Windows, but not Linux.

Product documentation only needs updating when underlying software edits trigger a change in workflow or usability. A developer changes the code for a payment gateway, but the payment process for users stays the same, so no updates are needed.

This shows a natural hierarchy for software product documentation. Technical software documentation forms the foundation, and subsequent product documentation is based on this foundation. Therefore, the focus should be on making great software documentation, as it breeds even greater product documentation.



## Example Formatting Frameworks for Product and Software Documentation

A piece of product documentation could follow this framework:

* *Product Name*

* *Overview of Product Purpose*

* *Setup Guide*

* *Feature 1 Explanation and Images*

* *Feature 2 Explanation and Images*

* *Customer Support Links*



Similarly, a piece of software documentation could follow this framework:

* *Software Name*

* *Overview of Software Purpose*

* *Software Dependencies*

* *Installation Guide*

* *Function 1 Explanation and Images*

* *Function 2 Explanation and Images*

* *Technical Support Links*



Clearly, these two documentation types are closely related to each other and follow a similar structure. This means that product and software teams have a lot to learn from one another, and a lot of potential when working collaboratively on documentation.

## Product and Software Documentation Teams Can Complement Each Other

There are stark similarities between product and software documentation. This presents the question: can product and software teams work together?

Yes, they can, and they should!

Software teams understand the technical jargon and underlying technologies. Product teams understand what users see, want, and need; the user experience. Software documentation writers can provide detailed technical information, and product documentation writers can dilute the technical details for consumption by a layperson audience.

Imagine trying to explain something in laypersons terms, without having the high-level understanding needed to formulate something a layperson would understand. That is what happens when product documentation is created before software documentation.

What is quantum mechanics? Schrodinger’s cat is probably the first thought in your head! But what does quantum mechanics have to do with cats? To the user, it’s not important. To a physicist, it means everything.

## Start With Software Documentation, End With Better Product Documentation in Docsie

To conclude, there are many benefits when using software documentation as a template for subsequent product documentation. Software documentation should act as a single-source-of-truth for IT personnel and product documentation writers. After it is written, product documentation writers will have the clarity and understanding to simplify and share user-friendly knowledge with customers, with technical guidance for proofreading and quality assurance.

Simply, by starting with great software documentation, your writers can craft even better product documentation!

Don't Worry, They're One in the Same!",1,
7/2/2021 11:46:42,Ciaran Sweet,"As a first port of call, any business selling products should ask how they can create product documentation. Documentation itself is a priceless tool, enabling businesses to share targeted knowledge with their customer base. When a business excels at knowledge sharing via digital documentation, it drives a significant customer-centric competitive advantage.

Consider any existing marketing or sales materials your business uses. These materials are non-authoritative and purpose-built to promote your products, and your customers know this. Contrarily, product documentation acts as a showcase for your product and its underlying features. It warms up cold leads in the sales funnel and facilitates cross- or up-selling of your extended product portfolio. Simply put, product documentation gives your brand authority, instilling trust in prospective and persistent customers alike.

This is proven by an IEEE study which highlights how product documentation satisfaction directly correlates with perceived product quality. The better the documentation, the more convinced your customers will be of product quality!

Do you have product documentation already? Either way, let us explore how to showcase the awesomeness that is your product using product documentation!

## Product Documentation Formats

Depending on the complexity of your product, it may be worthwhile using a specific product documentation format:



### 1. **All-In-One Product Documentation**

All-in-one product documentation is suited to companies that sell products with low complexity. Much like the Yellow Pages (used to) have every local phone number, all of the information for your product is contained within a single document.
If you have no product documentation, an all-in-one user guide will merely suffice short-term. As your product grows in scale and complexity, this format will likely become unsustainable. This is a prime example of putting all your product eggs in one documentation basket; what happens when the basket is full or breaks?



### 2. **Self-Service Knowledge Portals**

Anyone who works in customer service will know that self-service knowledge portals offer immense value to the business. Customers agree, with 89% of surveyed customers in the US expecting a knowledge portal to be available. In laypersons terms, this means customers want access to structured digital product documentation with search functionality. Without it, your customer service team will be inundated with simple low-level product questions.

When using this format, product documentation writers should structure content for readability. Short, concise answers beat long-winded explanations, and frequently asked questions (FAQs) should be front and center on the knowledge portal homepage.



### 3. **Contextual Product Documentation**

To maximize customer satisfaction, industry leaders go one step further than a knowledge portal. Contextual product documentation involves integrating knowledge directly within your product. When a user loads the settings menu for the first time, contextual documentation could provide a step-by-step walkthrough detailing each function. Alternatively, a knowledge portal could be embedded in the sidebar of your page, enabling knowledge searching without any extra clicks.

Contextual product documentation does take time to develop, but the benefits far outweigh the costs. This Forrester study shows how 73% of respondents think valuing customer time is critical for good customer service. Contextual help does value customer time. It eliminates clicks and provides immediate knowledge; helping customers start doing more in less time.



## Build Your Customer-Centric Competitive Advantage in Docsie

Whether you have existing documentation, or no documentation at all, Docsie is a great place to get started! Docsie offers customer-centric collaboration, extensive embedding, tailored translations, and powerful publishing – all at your fingertips.

### Understand Customers by Facilitating Feedback 

Understanding breeds empathy, and understanding your customer base breeds awareness of their needs. To understand, you need data.

Docsie enables customers to write feedback on documentation, and collects this data via Docsie Vocally. Here you will find comments on your docs, a rating from the reader, and a video recording showing exactly what the reader was looking at.

Data leads to insight, and insights guide action. Use Docsie Vocally to elucidate customer feedback and maximize the value of your documentation.

[Vocally by Docsie](https://help.docsie.io/jsfiddle.net?doc=/using-docsie/quick-start/#header-three-dcdes)

![Docsie Vocally Feedback Form](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/hfqdsijgxnujiyvnbfdo ""Docsie Vocally Feedback Form"")

### Structuring Your Knowledge Portal

A knowledge portal is only useful when it’s structured for easy navigation. Docsie provides structure using Books, Shelves, Workspaces, and content blocks.

As an example, a ‘Getting Started’ Book could sit on the ‘First Time Setup’ Shelf. This is contained within the ‘My Product Name’ Workspace. You could have another ‘Administration’ Shelf in the same Workspace, with a Book named ‘User Management’. By structuring your documentation using these Docsie features, readers can easily scan through and search for relevant information. Add as many Books and Shelves as you need; the sky is the limit!

Finally, why publish text-only documentation when you can enrich it with Docsie content blocks? Move your customers with moving, interactive elements on the page! Along with standard text editor formatting like headers, lists, and bullet points, Docsie Editor allows for extended tooltips, image or video integration, and iFrame script embedding.

[What is Docsie Editor](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/docsie-editor/adding-media/#section-header-two-ee89i)

### Centralize Your Docs and Perfect the Art of Publishing

With large quantities of documentation, decentralization can lead to disaster. By centralizing your documentation, employees can craft and edit content with ease. More importantly, this also helps with publishing.

Docsie centralizes documentation for ease of access using Workspaces. An entire Workspace, or individual Shelves and Books in said Workspace, can be published with two clicks. These documents are stored and hosted using Docsie servers, offering high availability and reliability for peace of mind. When your writers make changes, they will automatically propagate to your live Docsie knowledge portal. Advanced users can optionally self-host, enabling greater branding customization and more technical page element integrations.

![A live view of a Docsie Portal](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/ztrwbdcjznqcqkgofnhz ""A live view of a Docsie Portal"")

As part of publishing, versioning allows for ‘evergreen’ documentation that changes as your product changes. When you update your product from version 1 to version 2, your docs will follow illustrating any changes. Customers can learn about new features thanks to this, and even refer back to older documentation if they use or need an older release of your product.

![Publish Books and Shelves context menu in Docsie](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/fgzcadbebafclhvtrhvf ""Publish Books and Shelves context menu in Docsie"")

### Contextual Documentation Enriches the Customer Experience

Have you ever used a product, only to open a new tab and search for how to use that product? That product lacks contextual documentation, and it made you do extra work to figure it all out… not good!

Docsie users can leverage [TourGuide.js](https://github.com/LikaloLLC/tourguide.js/) to offer guided tours to customers, all without leaving the main product dashboard. The result is akin to an integrated knowledge portal, overlaying within your product and sharing contextual advice to get users up to speed faster.

How to customize your Docsie portal by injecting your embedded Docsie code into Visual Studio Code.

Docsie has a lot of customization capabilities. In this article i will guide you on the steps you need to take to get started on customizing your Docsie portal. Please keep in mind that i am not a professional developer, or designer and know that your tech team can use these tools to create beautifully fashioned Docsie portal far better then I can. This is merely a step by step guide on how to get them started!

## STEP 1

The first step is to get your line of code. He is how it is done. Find your account on the top right corner where there are three dots and click it. It will take you to Docsie's settings dashboard.

## STEP 2

Next, click on 'Deployment' button on the left hand side.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_UNFgmrrV4LJRPPcLD/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/f551ad37-a3a0-78bb-f97a-1246d5d57899Snag_1113a5f7.png)

Once you are in the deployment settings now you the ability to create a knowledge portal via Docsie cloud, or to create a knowledge portal via your own companies website by summoning a line of code in which you can add to your HTML and begin the styling process. This is done simply by clicking 'Configure a new deployment +'

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_66sDikYE16JfYewXU/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/4a8b6dd2-03d2-5d7a-837d-e3afdbe66900Snag_11161d31.png)

## STEP 3

Next click on the tab that says 'Custom deployment' type your website within 'Deployment URL' and then click 'Create web portal'.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_6CGgetG9GizkqY87p/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/4b102fcb-a424-8966-1f92-59b56e14241dimage.png)

Once that is done, make sure to scroll down and find your portal at the bottom of the list of portals and then click 'Get deployment script.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_el02yIrEUA3rf28CG/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/a64fc5d5-4e2c-9c6a-8325-6ed88a291db3Snag_1119813c.png)



## STEP 4

Now copy your script and lets jump onto Visual Studio Code!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_a3ExYoQ3yZSLnkf4y/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/1a26f697-45e9-b0c4-53d2-8ad808b8d49fSnag_111a44da.png)

If you need more information about how to get the Embedded code from your Docsie check out my blog about publishing your documentation with your embedded code[ here.](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/publishing-product-documentation-with-docsie/)

Now, within Visual Studio Code create a file (unless you have a file ready) for index.html, index.css. and index.js. Once that is done open your HTML and paste your code within the body of your html (under the </head> tag).

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ss2981O27UrVWVfrx/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/64bda798-9915-3b7b-274f-dc707b9118a2Snag_111c041e.png)

## STEP 5

Now for step 5 we need to create a 'Basic style'.

You can find more information about how to apply basic styling to your Docsie portals via our link here [https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/docsie-styling-guide/base-style/](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/docsie-styling-guide/base-style/)

For my example I added this to my HTML. and as you can see I added a company name link and I did some mild CSS to alter them.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_xg25e1fVbKEZbjJYl/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/a49b8d34-7911-10aa-741a-781224f57212Snag_1122dccd.png)

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_fRoPLO0Df6JhTcf2h/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/7c668c24-8d5e-8fdf-5b2a-ad93de3b313cSnag_11238581.png)

My results look very basic, but I wanted you to see the potential that your tech team can do to spice up Docsie knowledge portals and create portals that match your brands look and feel. Keep in mind that you may have a different style, and colors; in fact in most cases our users put their logo which is embedded with their website links, they add navigations bars on top so that their Docsie knowledge portal fit seamlessly and naturally onto their company websites and match the environment and CSS of their current sites.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_StvlIomWiDjQ8wV0h/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/e02de6be-1990-cbe1-7078-4e477ec4a6d9Snag_112473e8.png)

## STEP 6

Then the last step I did was add some styling changes via this text here:

```
  <style>
    :root {
        --docsie-font-family: garamond;
        --docsie-font-family-head: inherit;
        --docsie-font-family-mono: monospace;
        --docsie-hue-primary: 200;
        --docsie-hue-gray: var(--docsie-hue-primary);
        --docsie-sat-primary: 100%;
     
        --docsie-page-width: 1800px;   
        --docsie-notice-background: var(--docsie-color-primary-darker);
    }
    </style>

```
I pasted it below the last div tag of the ‘basic style’.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ORs7jTN5WvXJ7VkuB/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/4cc0127b-2bca-4d38-3040-864b8f5054fdSnag_112741dd.png)

And the results for my very basic style changes were this:

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_uCSLHwdeVry8finx8/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/82ffd090-9575-e89b-b0ed-16f4af08a405Snag_1127954c.png)

Now that you have all the tools at your disposal, give it a try yourself, and see how it feels to change things around and create beautiful knowledge portals that you can be proud of! I am 100% certain that your knowledge portals will look way fancier then mine! :) So give it a try and most importantly have fun with it!

Customer feedback is the forefront creating and optimizing appealing product documentation that your customers understand, and use to aid them with the use of your SaaS or physical products.

A lot of times companies are scared to knowing what their customers truly think about their documentation and this leads to a roadblock in finding out what their customers truly think about their product docs.

Why is this important? Why do we need to learn about what our customers feel about our product documentation?

If you own and operate your own company I'm sure you go out of your way to delight your consumers, to meet their demands, and to keep them loyal to your business. But how can you be certain that your efforts will yield the intended outcomes? You will never be able to provide your customers with the ideal product documentation experience if you do not try to find out what they think about your service. Their feedback on their experiences perusing and browsing your online documentation with your brand products is valuable information that you can utilize to better tailor your product documentation to meet their demands.

You may use client feedback to your advantage in a variety of ways. In this article, I'll try to illustrate why gathering client feedback about your documentation, whether prompted or unprompted, is critical for managing customer happiness and loyalty, customer retention, product and service improvement, and many other aspects of your organization. Continue reading to learn about the advantages of product documentation feedback.

What does product documentation feedback entail?

Customer feedback is information supplied by customers regarding their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a product documemntation, user manual and any online documentation provided to the customer by the company. Their feedback can help you improve the client experience and tailor your activities to their demands. This information may be gathered through various types of surveys (prompted feedback), but you can also locate and collect unprompted feedback from your clients by employing Internet monitoring technologies, such as Vocally – a feature within Docsie that allows you to observe how your customers react with your online published documentation. Both sources are necessary for obtaining a complete picture of how your clients view your brand.

Top-performing organizations recognize the importance of consumer input in their operations. They pay attention to their clients' voices on a regular basis. They not only look for thoughts that clients post on social media and reviews that they offer on feedback-gathering websites (such as TripAdvisor), but they also ask for input directly through various types of questionnaires. If you want to keep ahead of the competition, you must always pay attention to consumer feedback, whether favorable or bad, prompted or unprompted.

## Why is it important?

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1531537571171-a707bf2683da?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGxpc3RlbmluZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjU2MDEwMTg&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

Many SaaS and engineering products have a variety of user guides, user manuals and other version of product documentation which they provide to their customers. This documentation can be translated in to various languages, and have many versions. So why is it important to know what your customers are thinking when they are looking at your companies product documentation? Simple. Product documentation are designed to explain how your product works, and if this explanation is not comprehensible to your clients it could lead to churn, and clients who are annoyed with reading your documentation. Feelback helps to narrow the gap between their misunderstanding and optimizing the documentation so that they can comprehend the material in a more comprehensive manner. This essentially makes your customers happier because now they understand how to use the product documentation as it was indented and it instills a trust in using your brand, which shapes your companies reputation in a positive way.

Secondly, knowing feedback can deliver the product manager, product owner, technical writer and even tech team with information that they can use to help improve the product documentation outlay, as well as content to increase and optimize for higher comprehension. This is always the goal when publishing product documentation.

The following are the top seven reasons why client feedback is critical in the business world.

### 1.  Customer input aids in the development of better products documentation.

You presumably have an idea of client demands when you first bring a new product, brand, or service to the market. Market research conducted before to introduction may help you determine whether or not potential clients would be willing to purchase it, as well as provide you with suggestions on how to enhance it. After launching your products you now need to make suitable user guides, online product documentation by sharing your knowledge portal with your clients online. You hire a technical writer to write information about your product. A translator to translate it and get your tech team to display it online. However, you will only hear about all of the benefits, faults, and their actual experience after your consumers have used your products in correlation with your product documentation and provided you and your team with the necessary feedback.

This customer feedback provides insight into what aspects of your product documentations are performing effectively and what changes might be made to improve the experience. Your professional knowledge may be the finest in the industry in which your firm works, but consumer insights will always be more useful to finely polished product documentation that your customers will understand. Because you are really close to your products its good to get their feedback assists you in ensuring that the final product documentation meets their expectations, solves their issues, clears up any misunderstandings the products has and meets their requirements.

### 2.  Client feedback aids in the evaluation of customer satisfaction level.

Customer loyalty and happiness are important factors in determining a company's financial performance. It's connected to a slew of advantages, including improved market share, cheaper expenses, and more income. A number of studies have found a strong link between customer satisfaction and corporate performance. As a result, there's no doubt that you want to ensure that your customers are satisfied with your product documentation and understand how to use your products effectively. Getting their feedback is, of course, the greatest method to see if you've met their expectations. You can simply assess the degree of satisfaction and, as a result, anticipate your company's financial situation in the future by using rating-based inquiries.

NPS is one of the most accurate techniques for measuring, managing, and improving customer satisfaction that has been used by many organizations. The statistic is based on a single question that asks if a client is likely to suggest a brand to a friend. The loyalty questions provide response possibilities ranging from 0 to 5, with 0 signifying highly negative and 5 reflecting extremely positive. Because this technique is both easy and ubiquitous, it may be used in customer satisfaction management by any company. Vocally uses this rating as well, and additionally allows our clients to recorded videos of how their customers use their documentation. This information is highly essential and also gives companies the cutting edge in analyzing their customers feedback and delivering on future optimizations of the product documentation.

### 3.  Collecting client feedback demonstrates that you care about what they have to say.

By soliciting comments from your customers, you demonstrate that you value their input. You include them in the development of your company, products and product documentation/user guides so that they feel more connected to it. You may strengthen your relationship with them by listening to their voice. This is the most effective approach to recruit important brand ambassadors who will help you spread good word of mouth. And I'm sure you're aware that relying on their recommendations is probably the most successful and cost-efficient approach to gain new consumers and increase your trustworthiness in the eyes of present and future customers.

People enjoy it when you inquire about their satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) with the way your company formulated your product documentation. It demonstrates that you appreciate their viewpoint and are here to help them, not the other way around. They believe that your main purpose as product documentation is to solve their misunderstandings, and helps educate them on how to use your products effectively which is a proper approach to customer retention.

### 4.  Customer input aids in the creation of the greatest possible customer experience.

Today marketing is strongly influenced by people's interactions with products, services, and brands. People do not purchase brand name items just because they are excellent. They seek for quality customer service, user experience and over all good understanding of the products specifications and use case which matches their needs. They purchase the confidence to push their boundaries farther. Clients will remain loyal to your brand if you focus on offering the finest customer experience at every touchpoint. And, of course, the most effective approach to provide customers with a wonderful experience is to ask them what they appreciate about your products documentation which demonstrates the uses of your products and what they think may be improved. This is even more so for SaaS products which have many facets and technical aspects. The more educated your customers are the more they will understand the uses or your products and the more they will want to stick around and maintain loyalty.

### 5.  Customer feedback aids in the retention of customers.

Customers that are happy with your service will continue to do business with you. Unsatisfied customers who don’t understand your product documentation, and consistently get confused with how to use your product will ultimately seek out a better option to your company. Customer feedback may help you figure out where your customers are getting confused with your product documentation and what made them happy with the knowledge portal of your products and identify areas where you can improve. You can always maintain your finger on the pulse if you ask for comments on a frequent basis. When a disgruntled consumer expresses their dissatisfaction, you can respond quickly and find a solution to their problem. This is an ideal time to reclaim a customer and perhaps improve their degree of loyalty. In many situations, a dissatisfied client who had an issue with your products, services and or user guides which explain them but was promptly resolved displays greater loyalty to your brand than a consumer who has never been dissatisfied with your products or services.

### 6.  Customer feedback is a trustworthy source of data for other consumers.

In the world of marketing, gathering analytics and feedback it is highly essential to collect useful data and information to opt for optimizations and continue increase retention and bringdown churning rates. Consumers no longer believe advertising or expert advise in the age of social media. These days, the opinions of other consumers who have utilized a product or service are a more credible source of information. When you are looking for a place to stay in a city you are visiting or a beautiful new restaurant to dine with friends, you check reviews first. When you want to buy new shoes, you ask for advice on Facebook or read a review on a reputable site. Reviews apply to any business, especially SaaS products. Many businesses now include a review system as part of their services and products. This ensures that not only their brands can be shaped by the reviewers but also that they can work hard to gain trust of new customers and attempt to claim them for the long hall. Customer feedback is just as essential to your business as it is to other customers, so make sure you and your clients can easily access comments and evaluations.

### 7.  Customer feedback provides you with information that assists you in making company decisions.

When our customers viewing our documentation click this button and send us feed back, their feedback is automatically collected and viewable on our web analytics within Docsie. but that is not all! we can also see a short video of how our customers interacted with our documentation!

Let me show you how!

After our client or customer sent that nice little feedback:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_yGdEfZA4ZQSxUAdDV/boo_tZD1ykTPGDgzextMB/add6328a-0f22-b9cb-dbf4-0ebfc0467ca9Snag_d7b9057.png)

We can see it on Docsie. First thing we need to do is jump onto Docsie’s platform and on the left we can see “workspace, notification feed” and below those tabs we can see “Web Analytics” with a globe.





![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Uwq3GfsNK7QCj9St4/boo_tZD1ykTPGDgzextMB/3ab0e698-c291-cb21-0199-d6ab57198128Snag_d7c1bed.png)

If we press it and open the Web analytics’ button it will show us Docises feedback platform:

**This platform shows us everything we need to know about the feedback we have collected, our client who sent it, the date they sent it. And what portal they are referring to.**

1. We can play back the video when we please with this play and pause button.

2. This allows us to change the speed of the video being played. This is especially handy for large documentation portals which are previewed by our customers so that we can quicker pinpoint where they had issues.

3. This tells us what portal they have submitted this feedback from.

4. This is their comment

5. This shows how much they liked or disliked the documentation

6. If you have compiled allow to feed back Docsie allows you show only certain portions you require to analyses based on dates.

7. The configuration button helps us make changes to CSS and other aspects of Vocally’s feedback tool

Lets take a look now at what features Vocally has to offer by clicking on the ‘Configuration” button:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ItXaohEeulWngnN4y/boo_tZD1ykTPGDgzextMB/7ad80a03-ee84-3fbe-27f7-5c09dac0130eSnag_d7dbcdc.png)

**This is our configuration dashboard. There are a few different changes that can be made here.**

1. You can connect your feedback to email, Slack, Mattermost, Zandesk, and Zapier.

2. You can auto record your videos, or turn off this capability

3. This is the strip of code so that you can later on use number 4 to stylize your feedback so that it matches your company’s brands look and feel. Adding a strip of code is only required when you are publishing Docsie via a strip of code for your website. However, if you are publishing your Docsie documentation via our Cloud-based Portals, you will automatically have Vocally injected seamlessly within all your published knowledge portals.

4. This is for stylizing the Vocally.

Now that we have taken a deep dive on the importance of why feedback is nessisary for improvements and optimizations, building trust with your customers and how Docsie provides a solution to all these matters. Please feel free to try Vocally out for yourself. Sign up to Docsie, write and publish your first documentation, and then see how you like it!

7/8/2021 10:41:06,Tal F.,"![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614064642578-7faacdc6336e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDMzfHxjeWJlciUyMHNlY3VyaXR5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTc1MTExMg&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

Most companies have information, documentation, and projects that they consistently work on with their teams which must be secure while their teams collaborate on their ideas. Also, client information and other sensitive data must be secure, thus maintaining high levels of security is critical for any company. Document security threats can include:

**· Breach of security**

**· Data that isn't structured**

**· Unprotected Documentation**

**· Access to data that is not authorized**

All of this implies that you may be putting client information, customer databases, financial information, or even projects you and your teams are working on in danger.

A lot of times companies work on documentation for their new products and they need this information secure to other company members or subcontractors which they collaborate with to complete certain aspects of a product that is not yet released to the public. Some of these products have pending patents and the need to secure them is the difference between a breach and a future release on a product.

Collaboration and trust in your organization are more crucial than ever. This is becoming a commercial requirement as more clients expect that their providers be safe. While document security may seem intimidating, there are easy actions you can take to guarantee that nothing goes wrong.

## Internal document security risks are the most prevalent:

### 1. Prevent employees from falling prey to phishing scams.

The most serious internal danger is phishing emails. A phishing email is an email designed by a hacker who makes the email look like it is coming from a legitimate company associated with the employee's company and frequently has a link which the victim presses. In most cases, once the link is press this allows the hacker to have remote access to the employee's computer and thus they can penetrate it to get private information about the company and the future projects the company is working on trying to keep private until future release dates.

In a recent [study by North American](https://techaeris.com/2020/12/08/more-employees-clicking-phishing-emails), researchers found out that:

* *“67% of clickers (13.4% of overall users) submitting      their login credentials, also up substantially from 2019, when just 2% submitted their credentials.*

* *The Public Sector and Transportation sectors struggled the most, posting a click rate of 28.4%.*

* *The Education and Finance &  Insurance sectors performed considerably better than others, with click rates of 11.3% and 14.2%, respectively.*

* *Users in North America struggled the most with the phishing simulation, posting a 25.5% click rate and an 18% overall credential submission rate. This means that a      little over 7 out of every 10 clickers willingly compromised their login      data.*

* *Users in Europe exhibited lower click and submission rates of 17% and 11%, respectively.”*

This is a strategy that some nefarious competition companies use to steal product ideas from under companies' noses. Phishing emails now account for about 90%-95% of all successful assaults globally. Hackers pose as trustworthy entities, such as suppliers, coworkers, or even clients, and request sensitive data. However, if you know how to detect them, you should be safe! Make sure you check the sender's email address, not simply his or her name. Incorrect or significantly modified logos, as well as spelling errors and strange emails associated with strangely written websites, are other red flags. Verify the email with your IT staff if you're not sure to avoid compromising any important data.

Phishing emails can also be avoided if the company collaborates on writing product documentation that is password protected and secured by a platform such as [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/). It allows our customers to create product documentation in a collaboration format while still maintaining security measures and also adds the feature of sharing online documentation that is password protected. This is far safer than emailing such information because emails can be breached.

### 2.  Managing documentations

When access permissions to documents are provided on a need-to-have basis, product document security is at its finest. Password-protected new designs or new projects within product documents with limited access are an excellent approach to maintain a safe document environment. Electronic document management solutions such as Docsie have a lot of potentials. Docsie keeps track of documents and record any changes or other activities done to the document as well as the time and date which is digitally stamped. These trails must be constantly monitored for unusual behavior that might jeopardize product document security requirements.

This also brings up the problem of actual documents being left around the office for anyone to view. It's critical that this does not occur. Ensure that your coworkers properly delete important papers (rather than just binning them) or carefully store them if they must keep them. That is why keeping copies digitally online on a platform like Docsie is a really good alternative than having sensitive paperwork lying around in the office for social engineering hackers to stumble upon.

### 3. Keep an eye out for shared devices

Another source of vulnerability for documentation security is shared devices such as printers and scanners. To reduce the risk, only authorized users should have access to these systems' network applications and resources. Use your current security architecture to protect printers using a password or smartcard-based authentication, reducing the need for additional passwords. Print management software may be used to keep papers in a print queue and keep track of all document activities.

Access to physical ports (USB, flash drive) is also commonly restricted to prevent someone from stealing your private papers or infecting your company's network.

## Threats to patent-pending product document security from the outside can also be mitigated.

Despite the fact that security precautions are in place, documents can be hacked. To prevent security breaches, we recommend following these best practices.

### Keep your data safe.

A company's failure to use an appropriate encryption mechanism can be disastrous. It should go without saying that your company's anti-virus and spyware software is up to date.

Furthermore, limiting Internet access across the enterprise minimizes the risk of employees falling prey to external phishing sites or downloading malware that can propagate throughout the corporation. When public wi-fi is the only option, its also a good idea utilizing a business VPN and creating other security measure on the Wi-Fi network.

### Modify the document's format

According to a 2021 [Thales Data Threat Report](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/en-gb/euro-data-threat-report#download-popup
) , conducted by 451 researchers. They surveyed 2,600 executives in a range of industries and found that that 45% of US companies suffer from data breach at some point in their business life cycle. In 2019, data breach accounted for 65%. And even though from 2019 to this year the breach has been decreased, it still holds a huge problem for many businesses.

Sending documents as PDFs eliminates document format-related delays and transforms digital files into password-protected files with strong encryption and edit permission restrictions is a good way to send documentation back and forth. However, this is not practical if the documentation is product documentation that consistently needs to be altered. PDF does have security measures but using a platform such as Docsie which allows you to direct certain members of the company to manipulate and change documentations via the cloud in a secure way is much more productive. With Docsie you can set certain people to ‘Admin’, ’Editor’, or just a ‘Viewer’ of certain documentation. This will reduce levels of breach because only certain people will have access to and be able to manipulate the documentation. Docsie also allows published documentation can also be password protected so you can have certain people who have the password view the documentation. These measures imply that the user manuals, policies or product guides can't be altered by just anybody other than the document's originator, or Editor, lowering the danger of forgery. When utilizing Word/PowerPoint formats, hackers are unable to retrieve the information of the document creator.

### Choose your passwords carefully.

Stated in a[ article written by Identity Force](https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2020-data-breaches), in December 10th of 2020, Spotify had their passwords reset after finding a software vulnerability that exposed their users' account information. Spotify claims “*may have included email address, your preferred display name, password, gender, and date of birth only to certain business partners of Spotify.*”

This goes to show that even top SaaS companies have weaknesses with password penetration. This is why it is always important to never forget to maintain quality passwords! To prevent changing passwords every three months, our system administrators at Docsie advocate having a strong password policy along with MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication). It's also a good idea to remind your coworkers of some fundamental password rules:

Passwords should never be written on sticky notes and then “hidden” under your keyboards.

**Here are a few key notes on making a good password:**

1. Do not use the same password for several accounts and platforms.

2. The more time you have, the better! Check the strength of your password document at HowSecureismyPassword.net. -security-use-strong-password

3. It's critical to make sure that new employees go through an interesting and instructive internal training session that covers both internal and external threats. Employers frequently address this with a simple e-learning programmed or worksheet, but this is not always sufficient to ensure that staff are aware of the hazard.

### Docsie helps with all facets of security with your product documentation development, collaboration, and publishing with the ability to password protect your documentation.

### Here is a short video on how Docsie helps with security as well as creation password protected product documentation:

<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7R3WXOnXPE8"" title=""YouTube video player"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Lets start with how Docsie’s internal platform helps us to maintain security over how documents are written. As I mentioned above, here are many instances where documents related to new products need to be written and safely protected and secure. These products may not yet be patent pending but the product documentation writing process is still underway. One way Docsie helps with security in regard to this matter is by making certain that all documentation is written, send and managed only by certain parties with certain responsibilities.

Docsie allows the owner of a workspace to set up “Admins” (who can create new books and shelves) “Viewers” (who can only view a workspace and not edit or write on top of projects) “Editors” who can only edit books and “owners” who have all the power to transfers all Docsies capabilities and set members to the various positions within the Docsie project.

This is very useful because it show who is working on a given project and what they are doing with it, as well as limited those who should not be partaking in certain aspects of the project.

This ability is accessible very simple with Docsie. At the top right corner where you see three dots click on your Username:





![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ZjgXPtSl0RlVBr98x/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/cf10ca9d-cf81-cb56-4ce1-abe88f9919e9Snag_3dc21e.png)

Once you are in the Profile and Setting dashboard, then click Users and it should open the Workspace User Management dashboard:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_LusOK9N4cYs62tmgO/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/2a3683cc-6afa-d6a7-f19b-cf810211a89cSnag_3e7ce3.png)



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_0OL56vieZqzTE9UQB/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/72423478-b544-adeb-61e0-15929a28a298Snag_3ef5cc.png)

Now within this dashboard you have the ability to invite new users, change their “Roles” to “Viewer, Editor, Admin” and delete users who are no longer working on a certain project.

Now to add another level of security. All of Docsie’s users who are working on a certain project are will be tracked through our time stamp. This is highly useful for tracking who was editing a documentation, what revisions they made, and what changes they have done. This will tell us who and when someone had interactions with a certain product documentation project. Any form of tracking is highly useful for security purposes because it shares information about who and when someone had access to certain documentation.

It is easily accessible as well. Once book is open click on the circular clock image on the top right corner:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ZFC7kIcr91dH4Oglw/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/2edc1be5-9f18-dc5a-5205-9e769d5fb8eaSnag_3f7c90.png)

This will reveal a drop down on the right hand side of who and when someone worked on a specific documentation:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_GcHe7Y8M7cLwB7RGd/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/86ed6131-5980-e307-d00a-8479b5f9f528Snag_3fdb4a.png)



## Password protecting documentation with Docsie:

Docsie also allows us to password protect docs.

There are two ways to do so. By clicking in the three dots near your shelf or books.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_9tB3mDhl0WPwFiaht/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/160f814a-13bd-09f0-3e2c-a8b18bfbbab1Snag_4077e8.png)

This will open a settings tab, in which you need to click properties in order to access the password creation dashboard.

Note: if you click on the three dots next to your shelf then it will password protect all the books within your shelf. However if you click on the three dots and then properties within your book then it will password protect the book you have clicked properties to only!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Lo7CM1IekNCDS5rTa/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/17693cea-41e7-2b78-ee77-517b59923cd2Snag_40d605.png)

After you have clicked properties it will open up this dashboard then click “More options”:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_zN9LFzvG5tT00uXjc/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/6949063f-c31b-6650-ab89-bc6e8829f1f5Snag_416f19.png)

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_d5dR2xrdTlISl1rzV/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/9ce603b3-85e5-1711-24a2-0d290e77f887Snag_418cc3.png)

Once you have clicked more options it will open your entire password dashboard. Now you can type in your password for the book or shelf and enable the password protection. Done! Your books and/shelf will be completely password protected and only those with the password can access it.

When you think about 2021, you probably think of the digital world, because nearly every business nowadays has an online presence through which it advertises itself. But I'm sure you've come across a website or platform that you couldn't grasp as a result of an online search. All you had to do was go to an online machine translation and translate the website's text into your native tongue... Of course, you probably exited (bounced) the website in the end.

Because we live in such a digitalized world, increasing your brand's online traffic and traction is inextricably related to translating your content into another language and making it speak to everyone's wants and requirements. Content translation is a simple way to accomplish this.

## There are many benefits of translation product documentations, here I wanted to highlight a few of them:

All you had to do was go to an online machine translation and translate the website's text into your native tongue... Of course, you probably exited (bounced) the website in the end.

Forbes makes a good point based on a [study ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/)in 2020 by Statista Data that between 68% and 97% of people abandon their cards and do not go through with a purchase. Forbes states, in their [blog](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2021/07/06/is-your-company-ready-to-sell-globally/?sh=1c88a3957439), that they surmise that the only customers that “check out” and purchase the products is due to them having the ability to read these product information/documentation in their languages, and pay with their currencies. “In my experience, customers often “click out” or continue at checkout based on whether the information on the product is available in their language, whether they can pay in their currency and whether their preferred payment method and shipping methods are available.”

Due to the fact that we live in such a digitalized world, increasing your brand's online traffic and traction is inextricably related to translating your content into another language and making it speak to everyone's wants and requirements. Content translation is a simple way to accomplish this.

## Now lets go through the list of benefits of translating product documentation:

### Selecting the proper translation strategy so that you may expand the market for your translation

Of course, online translation tools is your first choice when it comes to getting your translation done fast and simply, but why compromise on quality when you can have it all?

It needs a better grasp of the myriad of cultural subtleties and layers to get your point across when translating into a new language. When dealing with exceptionally high-level accuracy translations into Asian languages, such as Chinese, one pertinent example of ‘how not to' translate into a new language is when dealing with China is renowned as one of the world's most antient cultures, based on profound Confucian teachings on the body and soul.

Choosing a translation technology and translation marketplace provider who can add a deeper understanding of these cultural undertones to the linguistic aspect will not only improve the translation of your message into a foreign language, but will also help your brand gain traction by making it resonate with the target audience's cultural framework and identity.

### Having your product documentation translated into a foreign language can enhance customer trust and increase the revenue of products.

People all across the globe prefer to consume information in their native tongue. Meeting this expectation at times can be a legal obligation and also provides an ‘open door’ police to all nations to partake in learning from product documentation, user guides, and overall knowledge portals that companies have online.

Translating your material into a foreign language may provide consumers with a pleasant multilingual experience, increasing consumer trust in your business and, as a result, increasing revenue, as online users are more inclined to buy when accessing information in their own language.

Users visiting on your sites and reading your content will experience a sense of familiarity and resonate with your brand, giving your business a consistent competitive edge and driving it ahead of the competition in order to enter numerous markets.

### Improving your documentation portals by translating them into a foreign language boosts SEO/SEM reach to other countries.

In today's digital world, Search Engine Marketing and Optimization is a major struggle, especially when it comes to the requirement for content to penetrate target markets and reach the intended audience.

Effective multilingual SEO/SEM strategies can be accommodated by translating your product documentation and other content into various language combinations, the more popular and high-ranking the better, multiplying your chances of achieving higher rankings and better search results, which in turn generates more exposure for your brand. Having product documentation that is translated into various languages offers your company with a cutting edge of targeting countries that do not have access to similar physical or SaaS products but require a translated version of product documentation to learn and use such products.

### The addition of a second (or more) language to a website's content can result in a considerable boost in traffic.

If you read [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117106531769704150), you may have come across Neil Patel, he is considered as one of the top 10 marketers in the world. In one of his [blogs](https://neilpatel.com/blog/translate-content-different-languages/), Neil claims that his traffic grew by 47% in only three weeks after he translated the whole content of his website into 82 different languages. Check out his blog, you can find a lot of other helpful tips.

This makes total sense since the reach of the content has become completely global and reach non-English speakers of the world. Based on a graph I found on [Languagenobar.com](Languagenobar.com ) English speakers only hold 26.8% of the entire world population. This means that if a company can translate their product documentation into Mandarin, Hindi/Urdu, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese and Punjabi that they will increase their reach by 58.4%. Which means they will reach over 4.3 billion potential customers. This is huge!

So based on these facts it is no surprise that companies are earnestly seeking for translation solutions to move their products into the larger global scope and increase revenue, and customer base.

## Higher conversion rates can be achieved by translating into a foreign language.

“*If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart*” said Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela was a spot about this. When your product documentation in the same tongue as your readers and they can't find any other information about similar products in their tongue, of course, they will become your loyal client and be won over, vs. going to your competitors.

For companies that provide products and services in more than one nation, writing multiple well-crafted technical user guides and user manuals is essential for globalization. No wonder: companies who interact in several languages and with multiple markets already know that knowing the local language and culture of each market is critical to competing worldwide and increasing their product reach. Nothing beats a translation partner that specializes in the topic to assist them in achieving that objective. In a BBC [article](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180403-inside-the-world-of-instruction-manuals), Roger Bridgeman, a former curator in the London Science Museum states: “instructions are there to compensate for the inabilities of machines by employing the abilities of users, and therefore tell you something about the state of both at the time they were produced.”

It's also worth noting that technical manuals come with a wide range of items, ranging from industrial machinery to vehicles and technological devices and platforms. Because user guides and manuals are a means of communication that has a direct impact on the user's understanding of the product and, as a result, their experience with the purchased good, using the right tools to get user manuals translated should be approached as a very strategic decision within a company, as the quality of the translation is directly related to sales success and customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, mistakes in a manual translation might have dire consequences for the client or customer who uses the items; such as causing accidents when handling or using the product, putting the user's life in danger. 

Regardless of the sort of communication breakdown and the potential consequence of a manual translation, one thing is certain: the firm responsible for the product's image will be tarnished. This is done by strategic steps in creating effective user manuals and guides and also translating them well.

This is a concern shared by professional translation companies, 

and as a result, they are prepared to implement a series of quality control stages throughout manual translation projects to ensure that information about a given product reaches the end consumer correctly and accurately in relation to the original content, achieving its goal

### Are you interested in learning more about how these businesses operate? Then lets take a look at the steps below to see what a skilled translation processes are taken in order to accomplish well translated user manual and user guides:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_8oLMBFJpm1n29PJnO/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/258bbf65-a0c5-a981-05fc-56bdf438257dtranslation_1092128_1920.jpg)

### 1. Correct interpretation

User manual translation platforms such as [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)have a network of partners that includes the top linguists on the market. Thorough recruitment, screening, and selection procedure with linguists from all over the world are generally used to create this network. Companies such as [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/) often use the following procedures when selecting translators: translator selection and résumé analysis; a test to assess the professional's proficiency in the translation source and target languages; and an examination of consistency in following instructions and meeting deadlines. Then, these experts, who are classified by nationality, language, and specialty, are evaluated on a regular basis based on their performance and the consistency of their supplied work. Attention! When selecting a translation partner, the quality of the translators' service must be carefully considered. As a result, do not be afraid to inquire about the qualifications of the agency's linguists in great detail. Also, lets consider language translation tools such as Docsie’s Ghost translator. It is designed to translate user manuals and user guides quickly at a high effective rate. If the product manager and his team prepare user manuals for translation by simplifying the linguistics this Ghost Translator can be a very effective and user-friendly tool that works quickly to translate all documentation as well as create alternative versions for the end-user to read. We must consider this also as a viable option. We discuss more about this below.

###  2.Extensive revisions to the project instructions 

Following the approval of the proposal, a product manager will be appointed to handle steps needed to initiate the translation of the user guides and manuals for their products. This specialist will be in charge of directing members of his team to handle user manual translations, as well as ensuring that the final file is delivered on the companies deadline. Validating the project's scope; elaborating guidelines for the professionals involved with the work; planning the translation in terms of scope, deadline; monitoring the processes, resources, and the evolution of the work; and interacting with the client to clear doubts and reports are some of the main responsibilities of a product manager.

### 3. Meeting the agreed-upon date for the delivery of the translated user guides and manuals

Working on the assumption that the companies have a strict deadline to create, write, translate and maintain their documentation for their end uses platforms such as [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)offers a useful solution that minimizes risks by allowing companies to use our easy-to-use platform and help them take leaps and bounds in speeding up the process in which they translate and maintain there published user manuals. These precautionary steps include making a real-time backup of the documentation on [Docsie’s ](https://www.docsie.io/)secure cloud-based platform and having their teams collaborate on various user manual translation projects effectively.

## Docsie has a comprehensive Ghost Translator that allows you to translate all of your documentation, knowledge portals, user guides and product docs into different languages.

## Check out this video to see how its done!

## Here are the steps to translate your product documentation, user manuals and user guides:

Once you are logged in, press the shelf and book you want translated, in this case I wanted to translate my ""Quick install guide"":

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_5udCDdXWMkuLzAlZl/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/232a9cb5-33a9-3548-b511-1259ae5c1076image.png)

Within the opened book on the left hand side you will see two tabs. The top tab is for versions, and the second tab is for translations:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_IiwdOR3z70l7T7fBI/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/a1eaeb07-7def-dec7-774d-cef4b7344d5aimage.png)



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_SD5stoqUyf3ZbpEPj/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/5465db5e-f11f-4214-2700-13c68122088fimage.png)

These tabs will expand and you will see pencil icons  to the right of the version, and languages, as well as an “Add version +” which will allow you to add another version and an “Add language +” button which will let you add another language.



Before adding a language you may notice that English says “CURRENT” below it and French says “DRAFT” below it:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_hTsq4reqGDozWF3CM/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/6fc2a5df-0875-9d22-d7c7-c40f31cc9505Snag_35e180b.png)

“CURRENT” lets us know that this language is set as primary.

“DRAFT” lets us know that this language is only visible within the Docsie portal and it will not be visible online.

If we click on the Pencil icon next to French we can change Draft to “active” and after updating the draft will no longer appear below the French language which means it will be present when we publish our knowledge portal:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_m4I8ulBxwLmeroluK/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/26f8c524-316d-a5b0-be0a-604d32ab69bcSnag_35eee56.png)



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_2l92rJQYCw2I7BERN/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/aa76e3d4-9438-ad08-91bb-4f31de03069aSnag_35f238f.png)

As you can see here the French language no longer says ""Draft' which means that it will now appear on the Docsie published portal.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_U7itpDh0YaJxLwo5h/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/84f2dfc0-8747-36bc-1cee-7b2935a26321Snag_360bd4a.png)

Now to add a language to translate our documentation into is really easy. All we need to do is press “Add language+” button:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_NywQdBTv6s2JrB6MP/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/78ea7719-870e-8f7a-73e8-7a444edf00c6Snag_36169d6.png)

Click on the language you want (in this case I wanted to translate my user guide into Italian) :



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Pd9C2Ef91JmD8C1y0/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/89bc66ac-2a6b-0863-841f-0eb75a5e5511Snag_361fcbf.png)

Once that is done make sure that the ""Automatically machine-translate from primary language"" nob is turned on and then press update 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_gtU5RhdhWYIoaMKpT/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/ac508735-96fc-c170-8c78-5c97a279c9e1Snag_3634165.png)

Great now we have our product documentation translated into Italian as well. Now by default it will be set as ""DRAFT"" make sure that you turn it from Draft to Active the way I showed in the steps above:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_b9y8pFOUrReeZCn1N/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/4117e519-3163-705d-0d9d-73fce39ee52eSnag_36589de.png)



Now that that is done, you can also delete any languages you don't find necessary on your translated knowledge portals. For instance if I want to delete French then I will first have to turn the language into a ‘DRAFT” by making it not active, and then press the three dots and click the garbage bin icon next to the language I want deleted. 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_kFGUptZJfjWH9kpQi/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/cea50cad-58d2-9327-9028-bd8e0be3a39dSnag_3670aff.png)

Note; remember to checkmark ‘Yes” before pressing confirm.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_B3C2T3v775jtYWV9Q/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/4b830098-7137-1751-f762-de97e5bc5934Snag_368101b.png)

And done! Now you have a translated book which you can show your customers, clients and employees online! The trasnlated documentation will appear in your published knowledge portals!

Collaboration is super important when completing product documentation with your team. Writing the right stuff in the right way with your production team is vital and having the right tools to collaborate is key!

Although the term ""collaboration"" has become somewhat of a cliché in the business world, it is far from a cliche. Collaboration in the workplace leads to productive teams and this is especially the case for producing high-quality product documentation!

Collaboration occurs when a group of people in a product documentation team, such as the product manager, product owner, technical writers, designers, developers, marketers, and other facets that create a well-rounded product documentation team joins forces to share their knowledge and skills in order to achieve a common goal which is to produce amazing and polished product documentation that their customers love to read.

Let’s face it! Whether you need to create product documentation, user guides, user manuals, or show any knowledge portal on your page, collaboration is essential to make sure all the pieces are connected in the right way. And therefore the company’s product documentation outcome is heavily influenced by your ability to collaborate with others.

Let's look at seven reasons why teamwork and collaboration are so critical in the development of product documentation.



## Why collaboration is essential and beneficial in the creation of product documentation?

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fFdIWXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjYyOTExMjA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

### It creates new communication avenues.

Working with new individuals’ different sectors of a product management department with other departments inside your company opens avenues that would otherwise be closed. Finding innovative ways to interact and exchange information is critical to a company's success in producing useful product documentation that your customers will understand and comprehend. Different sources of information and input can be brought together by collaborating with various facets of the company in order to help develop useful product documentation knowledge for your customers. This is why collaboration should be used to create ties across departments whenever feasible.

According to Mark Sanborn, “In teamwork, silence isn’t golden, it’s deadly.” thus creating a more unified, open workplace for your different departments to communicate benefits everyone. Furthermore, it pulls everyone a little closer together and clarifies your organization's ultimate goal, and helps produce amazing product documentation.

### Collaboration allows us to work more efficiently.

Working on your own has many benefits but when it comes to product documentation projects, the lack of information from various departments can be quite detrimental. We can concentrate only on one job without worrying about how much time we'll waste if we get sidetracked or how to assemble a team in time to meet a tight deadline. If the work at hand necessitates independence, then go for it. However, when it comes to product documentation, two heads or even more are better than one, especially when different concepts from the different departments combine together to make polished product documentation.

A Stanford [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103114000420?via%3Dihub) discovered that even the perception of working in a collaborated setting can boost overall productivity and performance. [Forbes ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2017/06/22/new-study-finds-that-collaboration-drives-workplace-performance/?sh=1f9c6da63d02)also noted that in this study: ""Participants in the research who were primed to act collaboratively stuck at their task 64% longer than their solitary peers, whilst also reporting higher engagement levels, lower fatigue levels and a higher success rate.""

Collaboration, on the other hand, is just more efficient for creating product documentation. We must be ready to confess to ourselves that we will require assistance combining ideas and concepts to create polished product docs. It'll have to be a collaborative effort. This is when teamwork comes into play. It aids in the division of a large workload of many product documentation and/or user guides, the development of innovative solutions to create understandable and appealing product documentation that your customers will comprehend is the result of the big picture.

An organization that prioritizes collaboration to create amazing product documentation that their customers love to read as one of their core values will inevitably mainstream this way of working, resulting in a more efficient (and appealing) product documentation workflow.

### Collaborating for product documentation with a high percentage of retention

Collaboration appeals to prospective and existing workers because it provides the groundwork for a more open, connected, and engaged workplace—perhaps even more so than businesses that are walled and isolated. Your employees will value an environment that prioritizes cooperation, and it will go a long way toward keeping them from searching for work elsewhere.

Also, when it comes to producing quality product documentation, that looks good, is informative, and fits what the customer is trying to learn about companies’ products having the various facets of the company input their information to create this type of knowledge portal is very essential. Marketing can talk about what type of customers are being attracted to the company, what region of the world, and other data they acquired from their analytics and statistics. Product managers developing product documentation for their customers need the most collaborative avenues. They need to know information about the engineering fourth product, marketing and sales of the product, and feedback from customers. In order to create successful documentation, they need to collaborate with these teams and departments to know how the products work, what kind of customers match their product fit and use all this information’s to help guide their technical writing teams, designing teams, and tech teams to create, produce, manager and publish effective product documentation.

People value fostering connections, especially in the process of producing product documentation that is appealing and comprehensive to their customers and clients. We all want to work with individuals we can trust, who understand and respect our viewpoints, and who collaborate effectively with others, particularly those with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. Simply, collaboration allows this to happen.

### Collaboration improves your company's morale.

People will naturally trust each other more as links are formed across teams and departments, which will progressively raise the mood of the business as a whole. After all, if there is a lack of trust, bad synergy, and poor morale in an organization, it will fail. Working with people outside of your team or department on a regular basis is one of the most effective methods to establish trust.

This also works in reverse: the better your company's morale, the more likely your employees will feel at ease working with colleagues from different divisions. This is also appealing to high performers, who are increasingly seeking more open, participatory workplaces.

Create useful methods to collaborate and your teams will not only be productive but they will also take pride and joy in working with your organization.

### Collaboration assists us in problem-solving.

When you're stumped, what do you do? Assume you've made significant progress on your product documentation project, but you've hit a wall that appears to defy all attempts to overcome it. You have run out of ideas, development has come to a standstill, and your deadline for the completion of your product documentation is approaching quickly. Do you surrender?

No, of course not; you seek assistance or seek a different viewpoint. You might have a brainstorming/whiteboarding session with your team or solicit feedback from a coworker. To put it another way, you work with your product management team to address the challenge at hand. Product documentation projects that have been halted will begin to move ahead again when your team combines their knowledge, skills, and expertise, then hash out difficulties and discuss potential solutions.

According to a [research study](https://www.adpri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/14215554/R0101_0718_v2_GE_ResearchReport.pdf) by ADP, the most quality engagement occur in teams with many possibilities for collaboration and exposure to novel problems.

On the other hand, collaboration does not have to be a last resort. Collaboration should be ingrained in the operations of your product management team. The more eyes that are on a project from the start, the easier it is to spot problems (and solve them effectively).

### Collaboration allows individuals to learn from one another

This is key! Especially for the creation and development of product documentation.

One of the nicest aspects of working collaboratively with people who bring a variety of skill sets and backgrounds to the table is the opportunity to learn from one another's experiences and information they gathered from their various departments. Collaborating with team members or even different teams should be viewed as a learning opportunity to produce product documentation that your customers comprehend and enjoy reading, so make use of it.

This entails soliciting views and ideas, exchanging information, learning how your partners approach their part of the project and getting a better understanding of how they work. Learning from colleagues is not only a benefit of cooperation; it's also the first step in creating a learning and development-focused workplace culture.

Teams that cooperate not only learn from one another—their errors, achievements, failures, processes, and so on—but they also develop a better knowledge of the other team's point of view. You get to hear their side of the story: their problems, priorities, and even how they think. Which will be incredibly useful when you work together in the future.

### Some Reflections:

With many facets and teams needed to work together to create and develop beautiful and polished user manuals, product documentation, and knowledge portals of any kind its highly essential to work as a team.

Many collaborative technologies, such as an intranet, do this. They're meant to essentially open up your company so that all departments can connect with one another and keep track of what other teams are working on via news updates, announcements, events, and discussion channels, to name a few. But what about specific tools that cater to creating product documentation?

Having a cloud-based documentation creation platform that allows your team to collaborate effectively is very essential.  Using [Zoom ](https://zoom.us/)and other virtual video technologies are a great way to stay connected with remote teams and display changes or issues that arise when writing product documentation. 

Also an interface like [Slack ](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/)or [Matermost ](https://mattermost.com/trial/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Google_Brand_NA&utm_adgroup=matermost&utm_term=matermost&utm_content=442324885582&gclid=Cj0KCQjwub-HBhCyARIsAPctr7zmyrCswx9f8GB_gVCUMAHiXE7_ZzThC2JNAkxc6htV7h_4UBG0IlcaAq4WEALw_wcB)is a great way to connect in a chat setting, it also allows to drag and drop items into organized chats which is awesome for collaborating with different teams.

That’s why [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)has produced useful features to help you collaborate, and assign various tasks with your product documentation teams with these reasons in mind!

## Foundational Concepts Of Successful Product Documentation Teams & Collaboration

The world is revamping the way we work on product documentation. Especially in terms of how we collaborate.

The majority of labor has grown increasingly team-based as organizations have gotten more global and complicated. Over the previous two decades, time spent by managers and workers in collaborative activities has increased by 50 percent or more, according to research published in[ Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload). This means that communication with various facets of the company happens on a consistent basis. 

In addition, product documentation teams are larger, more varied, scattered and more specialized than ever before. While these product documentation teams might be quite efficient at solving the difficult challenges that many modern businesses confront, some of them still have issues implementing effective collaboration strategies.

So, how can employees today communicate effectively while negotiating the prevalent work structures and dynamics that obstruct efficient workplace collaboration? Let's start by talking about what collaboration is and how it is effectively implemented to increase productivity in product documentation development teams.

### What does effective teamwork in the development of product documentation entail?

Collaboration is defined as when two or more individuals working together to develop or create anything. This can take place in person or electronically, due to the numerous communication technologies and cloud-based applications designed specifically for this purpose.

While there are many various methods to develop and maintain a successful product documentation development team, the most successful ones usually have a few key characteristics. It's an environment where employees feel seen, heard, and free to express themselves and their ideas. Meetings and work sessions are handled efficiently by them. They've put in place standardized systems and collaborative procedures. Their teams are aware of the significance of effective communication with one another. Also, tech teams and technical writers, as well as product managers, have an effective place to see and track product documentation being written on products as well as user manuals for their products. 

The ability to assign tasks and pin tasks and see what tasks need to be done in a managerial manner also adds a huge boost to the completion of product documentation deadlines and separating roles to help foster completion.

Most significantly, these firms' management recognizes that effective workplace cooperation to develop effective, comprehensive, and polished product documentation benefits not just their staff, but also their customers who will better understand the use case of their products and how to use them.

## Let’s explore the advantages of Collaboration.

Ensure that your team is working together efficiently in the office may appear to be a no-brainer.

Still, bringing individuals from various backgrounds and, depending on the size and structure of your organization, different time zones together to work toward a shared objective is no easy task. However, the benefits of good workplace communication and cooperation far exceed the disadvantages.

### Teams add more strength to effectively creating product documentation.

What do some of the world's finest products have in common? They make an effort to build an effective product documentation team to educate their customers about the effectiveness of their products.  Whether a companies product is a non-tangible SaaS software or a tangible product having their team working toward a common objective not only instills a strong sense of purpose in team members, but it also allows them to fill in each other's skill gaps and split up tasks to play to everyone's strengths. Why is this important for product documentation? Product documentation has many facets to it. It has technical aspects; it has linguistic aspects as well as design. By combining the technical team, with the design team and technical writers who are all managed by the product manager and product owner you have a force to reckon with, and they can create amazing product documentation.

### Collaborated product documentation teams are more skillful and knowledgeable.

Good collaboration teams have the chance to acquire new skills from one another, which helps them to advance in their entire personal and professional growth. The act of collaborating forces individuals to think more critically, explain themselves more clearly, and learn more about their abilities, all of which can aid in the development of self-awareness and a better knowledge of their strengths and shortcomings as well as increase their understanding of the products being sold.

Product documentation team members that have a mix of different cultural views are more likely to achieve success. These include people who have lived in a variety of places and speak a variety of languages, as well as those who have strong roots in the region in which they are working and promoting their products.

Translating product documentation into various languages and then having a team who understands these languages is an effective way to polish documentation based on these factors to better reach the heart of customers who live abroad.

### More creativity is needed to produce quality product documentation.

More and more businesses are forming teams that bring employees from all departments together to explore issues and come up with fresh ideas that will help create comprehensive and appealing product documentation that their customers love to read.

Not only can efforts like these help organizations harness the talents of the various departments and views, but studies indicate that groups create quicker, see faults sooner, and come up with better solutions to issues than individuals working alone.

### A more positive customer experience

A well polished and versed documentation which can be viewed in different languages, and versions. Also, with all technical aspects of the documentation simply displayed in a methodical manner and presented appealingly to the customer will increase customers using products and understanding their use case. This can all be achieved with effective teams creating product documentation that jives with all aspects of their customers creating technically sound explanations, that are displayed well and expressed in different languages and to different cultures. This can only be accomplished by a strong team that works well together to communicate their ideas about the different facets of a product's production and customers' use cases.

Happy customers who understand products usages, especially technical products, will give good reviews and essentially become loyal customers for the long hall and through word of mouth share their positive experience with others. This will essentially increase the revenue stream and foster a good reputation for the company.

## 6 virtues for effective collaboration

While the abilities listed above might help you collaborate effectively and create amazing product documentation, working well with others isn't only about what you do, but also the process in which you and your team implement them. The attitude with which you and your team approach collaboration may make all the difference in the world. Next time you find yourself in a situation where you need to collaborate with your team, keep these ideals in mind.

### 1. First and foremost, efficacy

Meetings are a very well pronounced necessity to collaboration, despite the fact that meetings are a necessary part of teamwork, they have received a poor name through time. As a matter of fact the Harvard Business Review stated in their research study that people send a ton of time in meetings, phone calls and responding to emails. The [research ](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload)states: “How much time do people spend in meetings, on the phone, and responding to e-mails? At many companies the proportion hovers around 80%, leaving employees little time for all the critical work they must complete on their own. “

And who hasn't spent an excessive amount of time at a meeting that seemed pointless? Several actions may be taken to transform your team into a high-performing machine of productivity. Having meetings well scheduled throughout the day via priority is a very useful way to set up meetings and tackling issues as they arise.

Also, a daily scrum helps to let everyone know what their tasks are and what issues they may be having as well as what they have accomplished the day before. The scrum is useful so that no one can step on each other’s toes for tasks that need to be completed as well as allow everyone to share their ideas about how to help manage certain situations.

Another method is to ensure that each meeting or phone conference has an agenda and that specific goals are well defined.

Finally, don't forget to assign action items to everyone participating in the product documentation project at the conclusion of every product documentation project that has been completed. This way the team may talk about strengths and weakens tat need to be worked on for the development of the next product documentation so that it runs more smoothly the next time around.

### 2. Explicitness

It is uncommon for all members of a team to be on the same page from the start. Individuals naturally have their own priorities and interests. That is why it is critical to establish everyone's objectives and agendas in advance in order to develop a common denominator that will propel the project ahead.

### 3. Positive Attitude

Simply because a collaborative effort failed in the past does not mean that it will fail again. Shake off any residual hang-ups and embrace each group work scenario as a new beginning, with an open and optimistic mentality. Positivity is contagious just as much as negativity. However, positivity inspires growth, inspiration, and fosters good work habits which will essentially increase overall company morale. Be positive and reward positivity!

Of course, we all have our off days, members who have their off days should be given space so that they can contemplate and transform their off day into a good day for the next meeting day. This is not a loss, but a win! Because one off day is better than an off week. And if one-off day can be recovered so that the next day the employee will be on point then that will work in the long run, and the employee will appreciate working for the team a lot more.

### 4. Fostering Trust

Individuals must feel secure in giving and receiving real constructive criticism, feedback, be motivated by a shared purpose, and have the tools and chances to interact. This can only occur in a trusting atmosphere in which employees believe their colleagues and leaders are looking out for their best interests.

### 5. Insight and emotional intelligence

Each team member plays a critical role. Nonetheless, teamwork can break down when one or more team members believe they are being treated unfairly or that other team members are attempting to tear them down. The more you learn about your coworkers and have an understanding of how they operate and the problems they face, the more likely you are to collaborate successfully.

### 6. Productivity

The most successful organizations have systems and processes in place that allow workers to refer to the schedule and duties of a project in order to have a clear knowledge of how their contributions impact the group. This way, if deadlines are missed or someone is not carrying their weight, the situation can be immediately handled.

Now that we know what a good collaborative team looks like and we know how it should be structured let us take a deep dive into creating certain processes that will help foster an amazing collaborative and effective product documentation team!

## 5 Powerful Processes To Creating An Effective Collaboration For Product Documentation Creation Team

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583506573326-f44ad9661e45?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGZpdmV8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjI2MjkxNjg5&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

If you've ever worked on a product documentation project that didn't go as planned, you know that encouraging workplace cooperation is sometimes easier said than done. Perhaps your colleagues work remotely and are inaccessible. Or perhaps your organization is overly compartmentalized, and departments are unwilling to exchange knowledge.

If your company is experiencing difficulties with collaboration, one of the finest things you can do is concentrate on strengthening your soft skills. Believe us when we say that learning these five collaboration skills will make teamwork much easier and more successful.

### 1. Communicate intent

Before you begin work or assignment, ensure that your goals are clear. Inform your teammates of your activities and establish reasonable expectations for when you will complete them—and be sure to adhere to them. These examples of good work ethic will show and pave the way to how work is done within your company. be a good example and communicate your accomplished work and requirements.

Additionally, share any changes to the strategy you have established. If something unexpected occurs and you are unable to produce the expected outcomes, explain these adjustments to your product documentation development team.

Again, this is where having an all-in-one communications tool comes in handy. Also, if your product documentation team can video call and instant message one another from the same app, there is a greater likelihood that they will communicate promptly when an issue arises:

### 2. Establishing objectives

When working in a team, it is critical that everyone understands the project's goal and vision, as well as how success will be measured. Setting up goals and objectives should be done for small aspects of projects as well as large ones so that all objects can be tracked with deadlines and optimized to increase productivity.

Also, if someone is working hard and meets objectives on time or before the scheduled date make sure to reward them so that their hard work is appreciated.

Transparency from all angles of creating and meeting deadlines and objectives, from the start fosters trust and helps guarantee that everyone is dedicated to succeeding and working toward a similar goal.

### 3. Listening attentively

When you work closely with people, you must pay close attention to each team member's ideas, criticism, and advice—and answer with consideration and respect. That is the concept behind listening actively and with intent.

While you may have your own views about how you want the product documentation project to proceed or who should do what, you must nevertheless consider your colleagues' perspectives. While you may not always agree with the conclusion, you must ultimately choose the group's needs and obligations over your personal desires.

### 4. Solving problems

Occasionally, situations arise, and individuals make errors. It occurs. When difficulties emerge, try to carefully assess the situation as a group without criticizing any particular individual. Rather than that, spend your efforts collaborating to discover answers. This contributes to the development of trust between team members and ensures that everyone feels comfortable speaking and being honest with one another, even if they make a mistake.

### 5. Effective time management

Collaborating with others requires you to be accountable not only to yourself but also to the members of your product documentation team who rely on you. Here's when time-management abilities come in handy. Prioritizing your tasks and scheduling them appropriately is critical to meeting deadlines and completing the job that your team is relying on you to perform.

Numerous technology SaaS companies struggle with the process of developing and distributing product documentation (user manuals, user guides and/or tutorials) to their consumers.

Often, this occurs as a result of a lack of knowledge or process about the proper handling and production of manuals, or even regarding who is accountable for them.

As long as there is the need of tools and software exist in this world, we will require effective communication to effectively convey to others the usage, development, functioning, and architecture of these goods. If you wonder why this is, the answer is simple. It is due to the fact that technical communication skills are crucial to collect information and enable the audience to comprehend the product or technology more effectively.

While communication in the actual world is made by speech, body language and emotion expressions, in the virtual world technical communication takes place through technical product documentation!

The only aim of technical product documentation is to facilitate the user's understanding of the working dynamics and architecture of a product and technology. It's more like a ""how to use"" handbook for your new workers, users/customers and anybody else who has to be aware of the working methods, a thorough description of the nut and bolts of a product!

It is the product managers duty to take upon himself/herself the responsibility of developing a team to create, manage, publish and maintain polished product documentation.

I am sure every product manager has said or has heard the following in their department: ""Product documentation is a component of the Product Owner's obligations""; ""Each development team should document their own apps""; ""the feature has been deployed, has the manual been updated?"" or, much worse, ""there is an error in the technical documentation.""

Clearly, technical product documentation might be a bit puzzling as straightforward as it seems! While individuals attempt to solve or argue about the lines in the preceding paragraph, manuals and tutorials deteriorate, which is detrimental to your ""product/company"" image.

To assist anyone experiencing similar issues, here are some procedures to implement to optimize your product documentation.

## What is the purpose of product documentation?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_AkCWDsRGayFUwrjU6/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/1945711f-8493-b2f6-a461-26ddae0b04acidea_3310390_1920.jpg)

When you're talking about product documentation for a technological product or service, you're talking about the information that describes it and the data that pertains to it.

Technical documentation, or product documentation, is all about helping your audience and customers utilize, read, understand, and utilize your product. Most product documentations, of course, are produced in diverse areas including engineering, medical, information technology, and marketing.

The great technical product documentation helps your audience navigate your product and enable them to utilize it without complications.

One other consideration is that technical documentation is critical for customer assistance and contributes significantly to your company's branding and confidence. When they're most in need, users search for technical documentation. The audience uses your product to learn about the processes and deal with issues.

This means having thorough and comprehensive product documentation which is dynamic with search capabilities is very important



## What are the different product documentation

This section allows you to see what kind of product documentation you need for your customers or clients.

There are many different product documentation types that meet the need of different types of use cases and user needs:

**Product User documentation:** This consists of user manuals, how-to guides, tutorials, FAQs, release notes, and training manuals, as well as operating procedures.

**Corporate documentation:** [Surveys show ](https://www.inc.com/david-finkel/why-policies-and-procedures-manuals-are-dead-and-what-you-should-replace-them-wi.html)that over 8 out of 10 companies, out of 1000 businesses surveyed use formal policies and procedural manuals. 

There are many other corporate documentation which comprises of documentation referring to companies policies and procedures as stated in he research above, instructional manuals, technical practices, behavioral and ethical documentation. As well as legal documentation which could be password protected. Also companies structures, best practices, and procedures, as well as maintenance manuals

**Developer Documentation:** this type of documentation provides instructions for software product development, functional specifications, technical specifications, documentation, and tools to assist with developer workflow.

Now that we better understand the different types of technical and product documentation let us discuss what the first steps of a solid management of product documentation development process begins with.

### Locate a head of product documentation development

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_PsI4RmXQikpEACQlf/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/eccf743b-f84f-655a-e8cb-52655df7bc4ccampaign_creators_gMsnXqILjp4_unsplash.jpg)

A very typical issue is determining who should be in charge of the product documentation, not as someone who just updates it, but as someone who is accountable for the product's quality and success.

While some businesses believe that each product owner and/or product manager is responsible for product documentation, as well as other departments such as development and support docs may also be entrusted with the responsibility of keeping user manuals, user guides and all facets of product documentation current and effective.

The development of product documentation has many moving parts but here we will point point two of them:

1. Who understands how the product operates at all levels (this includes the product development and specifications teams as well).

2. Those who receive input from customers who go through the product documentation and listen to their difficulties, feedback and concerns about understanding the product documentation at hand.

The first part helps us create the allotted product documentation with the knowledge at hand, and this gets sent out to the customer who in return give feedback and initiate the second processes which helps to optimize the documentation.

Sometimes these two points are not perfectly in place, and this produces situations in which the product documentation never receives the necessary attention.

One approach is to designate a person to be accountable for the, product documentation, product manuals and user guides ""performance."" Consider a purchase order that has ""Product Documentation"" as his product. He is responsible for going through all of the company's teams, sketching out how each Product generates its guides and identifying the challenges associated with that process.

The intention is not for this product owner and product manager to be entirely responsible for generating and modifying manuals, but to assist individuals within each team on the with document management.

This individual should study how users interact with documents, offer ways to make updates more fluid, and gather feedback to determine how to enhance each product documentation and explainers with its intended audience.

Having someone in charge of all facets of product documentation, managing the workflow, and the different departments that are required to complete this documentation will increase productivity within the company, establish awareness and educating customers with knowledge portals about the product and over all streamline product comprehension.

### Look at your product documentation as product itself.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_JdDBUtqTll6qYQgc9/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/cd6029ed-9933-9a5f-4007-c4d28888fa5ebram_naus_n8Qb1ZAkK88_unsplash.jpg)

Products exist to deliver a degree of value that meets or exceeds a customer's expectations. Based on [statistics generated by D2WorldWide](https://www.d2worldwide.com/product-documentation-why-do-customers-still-want-it-and-retailers-still-need-it/) 73.7% rate of people rate documentation more helpful than videos, packaging or salespeople when they are looking for information on products that they are considering on purchasing.

Consider the factors that contribute to a product's attractiveness. There are several factors that can affect a product's attractiveness, but for the sake of this article, we will concentrate on three. They exceed expectations in terms of value; their usage generates satisfaction; and they are competitive.

Additionally, same concepts apply to good online product documentation. Product documents that go ""beyond the anticipated value"" illustrate not just how to use the specified item, but also offer solutions that the client is unaware of or does not feel are possible. It is always necessary to see how other companies initiate their product documentation in order to learn from their successes and mistakes.

It is meaningless to have a company that develops unique and high-quality software that is ahead of the competition if the developers and customers who integrate your technical product documents are unable to grasp them.

Consider that the individual reading the product documentation may be unfamiliar with the range of possible solutions offered by the product or with the market (as is commonly the case with technical SaaS products), and so they must be ""educated"" about those solutions and various options related to the product.

Product documents whose ""usability generates satisfaction"" follow a logical reading pattern suited for their target audience. It serves no use to have the most thorough manual on the globe if it is a 500-page PDF or does not include a Code example and is not dynamically created with search capabilities, and other functions. Collect feedback from the users of your product document and your support personnel. They will ascertain the major areas of stress linked with the reported data.

Competitive product documentation are those that are continually updated using the most effective information exchange techniques. They have amazing features such as built in search capabilities, translations, different versions, embedded images, videos, and much more!

Even if your integration guide is the best written of all technology businesses, it will lack the attraction without an added video, and images and codes which can be copy and pasted for ease of use for your tech savvy clients who purchase your technical SaaS products.

It is always necessary to see how other firms initiate their papers in order to learn from their successes and mistakes.

It is meaningless to have a company that develops unique and high-quality software that is ahead of the competition if the developers and customers who integrate your documents are unable to grasp them in all their entirety.

**Product Documentation feedback**

Effective technical product documentation enhances the end-user experience by polishing the process to understand products and diagnosing any problems with readily available written solutions. When customers trust and understand how to use your products your, they could come back to you in the future when the need arises.

[New research made by SDL](https://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-writing/technical-product-information-impacts-brand-perception-893/) demonstrates that documentation's role in worldwide marketplaces is rising. [The research ](https://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-writing/technical-product-information-impacts-brand-perception-893/)shows that about 53% of buyers make purchases using technical literature before ever trying the product. Also, another compiled statistic from this research shows that 94% of buyers feel that having product information in one single location is helpful and useful. Because of this, each company places equal emphasis on product documentation as well as product development or testing these days.

Even if the documentation has a designated owner who manages the documentation team, they have created product documentation that has been revised and assessed for improved usability, and has been properly updated, you continue to struggle to make your users and consumers comprehend your technical products. This might arise as a result of the users/reader's inability to comprehend how your documents are being read or the queries they are truly asking. This makes one of the most challenging aspects of document composition is putting oneself in the reader's shoes. After all, whomever produces the product documentation should have a solid understanding of the product.

This expertise may cause the writer to overlook things that are not so obvious to the average user. Typically, this occurs when something that is self-evident to people creating the product is not quite clear to those purchasing and using the product.

This can happen in a variety of ways:

**Writing structure or form:** While this may appear to be a subjective word, even the manner in which a handbook is written can create confusion. It is critical to identify the sort of reader that reads the documentation; otherwise, words such as ""Developers prefer examples over descriptive text"" or ""Our documentation is not clear despite the presence of examples and visuals"" may occur.

**Topic organized in manuals:** Occasionally, businesses operating in the same market develop a standardized documentation format. If your company guides do not adhere to it, the reader may have a sense of strangeness.

**Excessive use of implicit terms:** When applied to a handbook, abbreviations may make little sense, even if the phrases are not acronyms. It's difficult to perceive, but some words, such as ""status"", ""id"", ""credentials"", and contain an implicit meaning disguised as explicit. Utilize particular designations, such as ""UserID,"" rather than ""UID.""

**Valid translation:** translation is a huge part of global reach. A lot of times companies create poorly translated user manuals and product documentation that does not match the culture of certain nations or simply the words do not translate the same way it would in English to that particular country. Understanding these subtle nuances can bring the product documentation a long way from unreadable information to a fully comprehensive and translated product documentation.

To avoid such situations, the aim is to develop a solution that gathers and analyses user feedback and navigation patterns.

Feedback tools such as Vocally a Docsie feature is a great way to reive and evaluate navigation patters and survey how your customers are viewing your product documentation. [Learn the 7 golden rules of gathering feedback here.](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/7-golden-rules-to-successfully-approach-customer-feedback/)

This information is critical to update and optimize your user guides, user manuals and product documentation to create a more seamless experience for your customers to learn about your products. Nothing is more frustrating than introducing a new product and discovering an increase in Support requests due to poor manual instructions.

## How to Write Comprehensive Product Documentation

Quality product documentation is captivating, useful and powerful. I would argue that adept documentation is a necessary component of good product management. As much as product managers take a huge part in the development of products, a significant part of success is creating amazing polished product documentation that our customers can comprehend and use to further their knowledge about our products.



### What is going on with most product documentation?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_6UrbmSp116NpfVK1l/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/64a68ac0-4ef1-308c-ad6b-5ce4525f5301jeshoots_com__2vD8lIhdnw_unsplash.jpg)

Many product managers are averse to drafting product documents. The product docs they are familiar with may not have traction with their customers unless more care is taken into making them appealing, easy to read and relate with.

However, a lot of times companies do not take the care needed to create and craft amazing product documentation. Poor product documentation is written for the sole purpose of being written. It employs expansive phrases filled with vaguely acceptable thoughts and poor layout to discourage viewers from interacting with the material. A poor product documentation is created to shield the author from criticism and is a complete waste of everyone's time. And their customers dislike reading it because of this reason as well.

### How do we fix this and write better product documentation which our customers will enjoy reading?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_NSTKBpS5BKDoj224Y/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/d83ce28b-38c3-bb53-8a14-2e1212d0fc5cscott_graham_5fNmWej4tAA_unsplash.jpg)

Excellent product documentation is written with the intention of being read. It is succinct. Good product documentation is well-formatted and can be read and comprehended by everyone in the company or customers in three minutes. It avoids jargon and either gives or refers to business-level viewpoint. An excellent product documentation spends time outlining specific use cases which the customers can understand and apply to the enhanced use of the product. It engages the reader and draws attention to underlying issues with well crafted solutions.

### The potency of a well-written product documentation

Where there are small, medium, or big businesses, well-formatted technical product documents may save a lot of time and help employees work more productively. This is generally true of most product-based businesses, who spend a large percentage of their budgets on hiring technical writers and writing technical product documentation.

If your business employs more than two individuals to create product documentation, establishing a culture of good documentation is completely worthwhile. There are many reasons why you would want your team to create, manage and publish well-crafted product documentation but for the section below we will address how effective product documentation is a low-cost approach to improve customer experience.

### Effective product documentation is a low-cost approach to improve customer experience

Solid customer experience is the forefront of keeping and maintaining loyal customers. Most project managers are optimists — they get a concept, become enthusiastic, and then execute. While passion is admirable, and execution seems productive having a game plan before executing proper product documentation is vital.

The first steps after brainstorming a gameplan is initiating a design cycle and structure the product documentation content in such a way that it will be progressively easy for their customers to read. 

Also, to gain feedback from their customers about their current documentation is a vital step needed in order to restructure the docs to match the customers needs. This way project managers can create, manage, maintain, publish and optimize their documentation with perception and automation. This is not a simple and miniscule task, and having amazing tools like [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)which automates a lot of the processes for making product documentation effective is quite essential for success.

Attractive, engaging, and navigable technical documentation helps consumers learn the product in less time, which increases the likelihood that they will set up the product correctly and use it correctly.

All these strategies of creating well-polished product documentation will essentially lead to higher rated products, more favorable reviews, and more sales are all tied to one other; therefore, it goes without saying that the increased sales as a result.

## How to create well-crafted product documentation

How to produce effective documentation and foster a culture where it is the standard? Writing effective documentation is challenging, and but there are many good features within [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)that can help seed up this process of making well crafted and dynamic product documentation portals. The following is a high-level summary of how we approach the issue.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_yl3vJ0vYDWgB1AnFf/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/7b97f8c4-af64-8ddc-c06b-93e6f28fea96dayne_topkin_y5_mFlLMwJk_unsplash.jpg)

### Now lets get started:

**Page limitations ensure readability.** Writing a decent document shouldn’t be difficult to read and mentally process. Protracted, meandering phrases are frequently indicative of a lack of clarity. If the communication cannot be properly summarized on a single page, it is an indication that the product manager should probably go back and further break down the situation.

**Formatting improves the quality**. A poorly structured product documentation increases the likelihood that the writer will wing it. Create a template with well-formatted sections, tables, and document headers. It's a one-time investment with high dividend potential.

**Templates help you save time. **It's far easier to delete a section from a template than to remember to add one. It is not patronizing; rather, it is effective and time saving. Simple sections that remind the writer to begin with the broad background and to be specific about measurements or hazardous assumptions enable more precise writing and decision hierarchy.

**Comment and assign tasks** There is no surer way to demotivate your staff from producing high-quality documentation than by failing to remark on them. Comments do not need to be very smart; rather, they should indicate involvement and serve as a model. While it is ideal to provide feedback digitally so that others in the company may benefit asynchronously from the conversation, a simple feature in Docsie which allows you to comment and collaborate with your team works product documentation team great!

**https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/collaboration-to-create-well-polished-product-documentation/**

**Document types should be scalable to meet the demands of your company.** As more stakeholders get involved in the product development process, communication must be divided into several documents (particularly if the one-page 'conciseness' criteria is to be met). Docsie allows for a useful and sustainable solution for growing product documentation teams.

There are also many other features and capabilities that Docsie allows you and your product management team to use to craft amazing product documentation. In this article I would like to jump into plugins that each Docsie knowledge portal and product documentation can add-on to their documentations to enhance them and improve their over all usability.

## Docsie plugins to make your Documentation portal dynamic!Docsie has a bunch of plugin you can use to make your documentation more appealing. In this blog I will divide it into 3 parts. 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_4LttTJbkU67oXkSZX/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/898e185c-08b3-55da-e9c4-1031ad6792f5Snag_c3ee39d.png)

In this section we will divide the explanation of these knowledge portal plugins into three parts.

**PART 1: **The first part we will show what we will show what the 'Display Version Picker', 'Display Language Picker', the 'Display Section Anchors', and the 'Display Footer Navigation

**PART 2: **In this part we will show the 'Code Highlighting', 'Search', and the 'Share to Social Network' plugin

**PART 3: **In part three we will show the 'Image Preview, 'Document Metadata', and the 'Auto-highlight Section' plugin.



Before we jump into the plugins lets talk about how to access these plugins within the Docsie Platform.

First, within the workspace, we need to click onto the three dots at the top right corner and open our account: 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Mv9BSfFjt63Bq12ui/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/4ee73eb8-90f3-4588-7cad-537d6c3d2606Snag_fb448a0.png)

Then within Deployments we can access the Plugins once we create a new Deployment via 'Configure a new deployment+' 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_EyeRwNDqJuiL6yclc/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/c3aa28de-aeff-0f8e-5b66-3e0f7cbdc564Snag_fb8dbd4.png)

Then click 'More options' which will allow you to add these plugins into your Deployed documentation via your an imbedded script or via the Docsie portal



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_3BNU4lygMNvB6VhgK/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/c16fe2e1-c05b-4574-1b90-5beb78b1ccceSnag_fb8f18f.png)

The other option is to access Docsie's knowledge portals plugins through the 'Update deployment configuration' button below your already published documentation.

lets start with the 'Display version Picker', and the 'Display Language Picker' 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_9F8xevNxryqXJuual/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/3539432f-5e55-7c68-c8ff-6e10ccaaf16fimage.png)

Once these two are active they will appear on the bottom left of your knowledge portal as floating tabs.  They allow your customers and those reading your product documentation to view your product docs in different languages and versions.





![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_15B6AEHxast4mhcXQ/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/3dc1ff60-4be8-3457-f12c-be1f2bbff93aimage.png)

Once the user presses the Language within the language picker it will change their entire documentation that they are reading into that allotted language.

The Display Section anchor once activated allows your customer to have links next to each header which will give them links to certain sections of the documentation.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_yKD6jx7Sg0HdhzQ95/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/d5797b47-678b-f896-0387-9fb4ad7588e8image.png)

Every time these links are pressed, apart of the header will change and when your customer copies and pasts this html, it will direct the person they are sending it to, to this specific section of the documentation.

Next is 'Display Footer Navigation' 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_OUljvQnuFNAphGApN/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/aa4b47a1-72d2-3218-9cb6-96c7afe5d813image.png)

This plugin adds a navigation button at the bottom right of your documentation Book. It looks something like this.

 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_56mbG9THAGa94XROc/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/90593fea-48fa-92d7-b3de-dbc4955c7c0fimage.png)

This plugin is great for technical products which need to express various codes to their customers. This plugin allows their customers to copy and paste the allotted code so that they can use it on their editor for ease of use by adding a ""Copy"" button.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_W2SjxQvvsp5Vut9t4/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/86322d6d-d84a-3e3d-80b2-33a74fef6d64image.png)



Now let us dive into the Search plugin.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_p3P3TLvZzKG3maz4h/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/67acc913-8ece-2d3d-70d1-37a278f118e9image.png)

Once activated on your Docsie's knowledge portal your customers can search through your documentation via a search navigation on the top right corner of the knowledge portal.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_7jrRLle6xCtIb3FiY/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/f39bac8d-787f-aa59-34b0-d86b3f505004image.png)

This highly speeds up the process in which your customers can find and retrieve their well needed information about your products.



Next is the Share To Social Networks plugin

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_0drhefPXvSjuyfjVF/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/382f6e99-41cc-698a-b66a-81ac9175b29cimage.png)

This plugin allows your customers to grab  highlighted sections of your written product documentation and share it within their social media. 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_dbo2n8uLjl1G1ivb4/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/0ae0c1e2-c3eb-d412-44d5-84602d468dccimage.png)

# Level Up Your Docsie Experience With 10 Powerful Tools


## 1. Pro Writing Aid

First, we have Pro Writing Aid. This is a grammar, spelling, and sentence structuring tool that helps writers create product documentation.

If your (oops!) unlikely to remember &quot;you&#39;re&quot; vs &quot;your&quot; when writing, this tool catches errors and provides contextual recommendations on the fly.

It can also provide a reading grade level (e.g. Grade 13), sentence variety monitoring (short sentences followed by long sentences), and passive voice (&quot;I will do the work&quot; vs &quot;The work will be done by me&quot;).

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_sBDe8ADHXLhzOI7Bt/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/a876561b-106c-2150-6e2a-5d7a8522eba5ProWritingAidDocsieImage.png)

Grammar, spelling, and sentence structuring is more important than many people give credit. When a customer sees bad grammar, spelling mistakes, and paragraph-long sentences – it makes them lose confidence in your product. For example, a high reading grade level for a product targeted to kids is counterproductive. Passive voice tends to waste screen real estate and feels roundabout for readers, whereas active voice is short, sweet, to the point.

Add Pro Writing Aid to your Docsie workflow; improve your words, inspire your customers.


## 2. QuillBot

Paraphrasing is a common practice in content development, and this rings true when you create product documentation. Sadly, as much as we want to believe it, we weren&#39;t the first person to have that idea and put pen to paper!

Paraphrasing is as simple as saying the same thing with different words. QuillBot is an AI software tool that automatically paraphrases for you, avoiding plagiarism and its reputational or copyright-related consequences.

&quot;How would one go about paraphrasing?&quot;

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_cwSR1syhFEDnzXYY6/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/de4f4ee5-a94a-5f35-9b0f-3f6b482f1766QuillBotDocsieImage.png)

Just type your sentence, click &quot;Rephrase&quot;, and a paraphrased excerpt will appear on the right side. Neat, huh?

Consider giving QuillBot a try along with Docsie if you repurpose content on the internet. We always recommend being original, QuillBot is simply a tool that automates originality.


## 3. Snagit

Product documentation isn&#39;t just words… it needs images and artwork to illustrate the full picture (pun intended). By providing step-by-step instructions with accompanying images, users have greater certainty and confidence when following user product guides.

On Windows, the [Snipping Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b) is available. For Linux, [screenshots can be taken](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en) using (Shift/Alt)+PrintScreen keyboard shortcuts. On macOS, [this is done](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh26782/mac) with Shift+Command+5. Functionality is limited, however.

Next on our list of software documentation tools is Snagit. It goes one step further as an all-in-one screen capture tool. Users can take entire display screenshots, windowed screenshots, or draw a screenshot capture zone. Snagit can also capture video and voice recordings, such as through a webcam. The best part is its editing functionality, enabling annotations like arrows and text in screenshots, or trimming and sound overlay for GIFs and video.

Simply put, Snagit is a screenshot, video editing, and communications solution built for product documentation writers. Consider giving it a try the next time you need images for your Docsie Books!


## 4. Camtasia

From the makers of Snagit (is this a movie trailer?) – next we have Camtasia!

Camtasia is similar to Snagit, but focuses on screen recording and video editing. Users can take advantage of video templates with transitions and modern styles, and share templates with the team to streamline video creation workflows. The royalty-free Camtasia asset library adds visual flair without the copyright burden. Similar to Snagit, Camtasia supports annotations, device framing (full screen, windowed, draw an area), and dual-input audio recording (both microphone and system sound).

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_47zfmEreV6BA7FICb/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/f1407819-11cb-74ad-0b1c-66fdd48ee401CamtasiaDocsieExample.png)

Camtasia on YouTube is so 2008, but it&#39;s not too late to start using this tool to create product documentation in Docsie. Give your docs some boom boom pow!


## 5. Tableau

Data truly makes the modern world go round! Raw data, however, is difficult to understand for humans. Computers deal with raw data all the time.

Tableau takes raw data and converts it into beautiful visualizations, making it easier for all audiences to see and interpret patterns, trends, and other data insights. It supports a wide range of database types including relational databases (RDBMS), non-relational databases (non-RDBMS) and object-oriented databases (OODBMS) – leading to virtually unlimited data visualization potential.

Here is an example Tableau visualization embedded in a Docsie Book.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_mgVz26JU76a3LADfX/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/8bee7e83-e25a-946d-bca9-08f5ad7588b4TableauforDocsieExample.png)

Test this visualization yourself! Open Docsie, create product documentation (a Book), and select the Embed button in Docsie Editor. From here, paste the embed code and resize to fit your webpage (vizElement.style.width and vizElement.style.height attributes)

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/boo_uyETYF3HNzbtX0KaY/3a781b86-b930-fce7-2bdf-4bfa373b4243add_image_toolbar.png)

Embed Code (paste me!)

```html
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1627317652504' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='The Cost of 1 GB Mobile Data ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;C5&#47;C5MHTKH3N&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='path' value='shared&#47;C5MHTKH3N' /> <param name='toolbar' value='no' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;C5&#47;C5MHTKH3N&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='filter' value='mobile=' /><param name='language' value='en' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1627317652504');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='1050px';vizElement.style.height='1305px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
```

If your product documentation uses statistics and data, make it easier (and prettier) for users by using Tableau. Docsie supports Tableau embedding using iFrame technology, so give it a try!


## 6. Draw.io

An electrician never attempts to rewire and reroute electrical cables without a schematic or diagram. With that in mind, users can learn the ins and outs of your product faster when you provide diagrams and flow charts.

Product documentation writers can use Draw.io to create flowcharts and diagrams. This software documentation tool provides templates and hundreds of assets to build engaging, visually pleasing charts. For example, with computer systems and network topology, diagrams and flowcharts elucidate system hierarchy and the flow of data. Do the same for your products by elucidating underlying workflows and functionality

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_jo79eJ1rF0UIUwNSA/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/e200dcc3-16f1-cd55-b228-1e5e90286f9fDrawioDocsieExample.png)

Draw.io is another tool that supports iFrame embedding. Create product documentation, then embed directly in your Docsie docs! Alternatively, you can take a screenshot with tools like Snagit, but we recommend iFrame as edits to the chart will propagate automatically.

## 7. Statista

Statistics increase the authority of documentation. To include statistics, try Statista when you next create product documentation for comparisons against competitors, to illustrate market conditions and how your products tackle it, or just to add some oomph!

Statista collects data across 170 industries in 150+ countries, making it one of the best digital sources of statistical data. All data is backed by peer-reviewed studies, and some data charts even show projections and forecasts.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_RUhjD6bkfd8IBFEKc/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/34ef079d-93ed-84f0-97fd-f3642905d6b8StatistaMainDocsieExample.png)

Statista is great as it supports iFrame embedding, allowing you to embed graphs and charts in your Docsie documentation. These graphs and charts update over time, ensuring your statistics remain evergreen!

Create a Statista account and try embedding statistics in your next Docsie Book!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_huVo7yXmIBx1LAGHf/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/e97c9506-cfdb-ab1f-828b-114c97dd0003StatistaAltDocsieExample.png)

## 8. CodePen.io

Software product documentation is a different beast than physical products. It includes high-level technical information, code snippets, and dependencies – especially when catering to the developer or engineering crowd instead of layperson users.

A screenshot of JavaScript code offers little to developers and engineers reading your documentation, however. You can&#39;t Ctrl+C code if it&#39;s in an image! What they need is front-end code sandbox with build, test, and sharing functionality.

In a sea of software documentation tools, CodePen.io is particularly great for executing and illustrating sandboxed code.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_k5vSeT7kpOHl4UjHP/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/804fb7d8-95fe-777e-ea16-3ebea86bdcbdCodepenDocsieExample.gif)

Code in CodePen executes in real-time on the page, showing exactly what your code does to users. This is great if your product supports custom code, as you can share a library of templated functionality for users to enjoy. Finally, the sandbox environment encourages experimentation, inspiring users to try new things and fully explore the limits of your product.

Embed code (paste me!)

```html
<p class=""codepen"" data-height=""300"" data-default-tab=""html,result"" data-slug-hash=""gOWXMJp"" data-user=""amit_sheen"" style=""height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"">

</p>
<script async src=""https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js""></script>
```

Try CodePen.io embedding in Docsie, and take advantage of our native code highlighting feature to help your developer users do more with your docs!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_vvYoRQeiL3LCUVDAS/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/66d06474-e719-fcc0-7823-994eb242ba28CodeHighlightingDocsieExample.png)

## 9. Doxygen

A lesser-known tool, but helpful for developers and software documentation writers. Doxygen (not related to Docsie!) automatically creates software documentation by scanning through code and identifying parameters, attributes, comments and more.

An extension for Doxygen is CLion, which enables you to view Doxygen documentation outputs in real-time in the code editing view.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_2cPEUGCErPeWsXEGC/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/f892b701-5578-e660-2045-67bacdad9bf8DoxygenCLIONDocsieExample.png)

Here is an example exploring the [iTunes COM Interface](http://www.joshkunz.com/iTunesControl/). Supply the source code, and the documentation writes itself!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_rtD8sCQOi1D4bB7jZ/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/9a57672a-6b0c-65c9-d40c-117b548f0ebbDoxgenOutputDocsieExample.png)

Try using Doxygen and copy the results into Docsie. Then, you can use our code highlighting plugin and other formatting options!

## 10. Pixlr E

We&#39;ve already explored how to capture images with Snagit. What&#39;s missing is a powerful way to edit images on desktop and mobile. Adobe Photoshop is powerful, but the hardware requirements and licensing costs limit its use to designers, artists, and creative professionals.

For simpler documentation purposes, consider Pixlr E. This is a web-based product documentation tool with much of Photoshop&#39;s functionality, but without the need for installation on a device.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_DDQflhicLbRwoBg51/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/c25d3546-c21e-994c-793c-9ae51a701733PixlrEDocsieExample.png)

You can add text, lasso and copy pixels, blur, fill with color (using hex values or RGB color wheels), crop, brush, pen, liquify, auto-heal, add or remove layers and much more! Edited images are saved in the cloud ready to be accessed or shared; all you need is a modern browser.

Give Pixlr E a try while taking screenshots! After, you can copy and paste exported images directly into Docsie!

## 11. JotForm

Docsie already has a feedback form for documentation – Docsie Vocally. This is only for reader feedback on Docsie Books, however, and not for general feedback.

Product documentation tools like JotForm allow you to create dynamic web forms and embed directly in Docsie Books. One example is for knowledge bases, where below each article you could include an IT Service Ticket form.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_PilAiIswkzAypwYPD/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/2712e505-5066-1206-005b-b41a3a907d28JotformDocsieExample.png)

Integration with ZenDesk means form responses can be automatically loaded into IT service desk ticketing software!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_B0XeGkP8hxM7CC5rP/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/49b6ff57-5a3d-0dbe-ab79-13d2d5e41545JotformtwoDocsieExample.png)

Try adding JotForms to your Docsie Books! Feedback forms are invaluable in pursuit of documentation excellence; you can&#39;t fix what you don&#39;t know!
