This is important for various aspects of building and developing products and projects as well as releasing them and educating customers and employees about different aspects of products, features, and their roles.\n\nAlthough technical documentation may appear difficult, it does not have to be. In this article, we will teach you all you need to know about it so that you can get started on creating and maintaining amazing technical documentation for your produ8cst and projects.\n\n### What is technical writing?\n\nTechnical documentation exists in a variety of forms and formats, although it is now mostly available online. Despite the fact that technical documentation is often created by technical writers, development teams, project managers, developers, and other industry professionals, the finest technical documentation communicates information simply and clearly enough for everyone to comprehend. Otherwise, it falls short of its intended function.\n\nTechnical documentation refers to documents that detail a product's characteristics and functions. It is most frequently developed in the software development industry by development and product teams and may be used to address the support needs of various stakeholders within an organization.\n\nThey provide context for items related to the product. Whether they describe a product's usage, technique, functions, features, or development, the end objective is to educate the reader about a particular element of the product. This is true regardless of whether they are utilized in software development, product development, or other areas.\n\n### Who is the intended audience for technical documentation?\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_gwW0HhhGm84k7Ee0A/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/0c71d6f4-58ef-a35c-75b5-03d70464afc6melanie_deziel_fSWQPBxqClg_unsplash_(1).jpg)\n\nAudiences may be defined in a variety of ways, ranging from end-users to programmers to stakeholders. It varies considerably depending on the type of material in question.\n\nNonetheless, process-based technical documentation is frequently produced with an eye toward other audiences. They might be developers, stakeholders, clients, or other members of the internal team. Although this type of documentation is less frequently utilized than product-based documentation, its purpose is to offer a more in-depth look at the various technical elements that comprise a product.\n\nAt the end of the day, technical documentation is often created for the benefit of the product's users. Its primary objective is often to assist users in accomplishing certain tasks with a product, and so end-users should always be considered while producing the different types of technical documentation.\n\n### What is the significance of technical documentation?\n\nThere are several reasons for the importance of technical documentation. However, it all boils down to one critical advantage. The main reason for technical documentation creation is to inform the public about a product.\n\nThis assertion may seem self-evident, but let's go a little further. After all, a product is completely useless if consumers lack sufficient knowledge about it. A lack of information results in individuals being unable to utilize a product properly or lacking the necessary expertise to really comprehend it.\n\nTechnical documentation is critical from the end user's perspective since it enables them to utilize a product efficiently. This is doubly advantageous for the firm that produces the technical documentation since it reduces customer care hours and results in happy users who can troubleshoot and answer their own queries.\n\nInternally, technical documentation is critical because it provides employees with the knowledge they need to work efficiently on a product, whether it's highly technical material or a high-level overview of planning and processes.\n\nIn any case, products are not always self-explanatory. That is why we require technical documentation to provide us with all of the information we require about them.\n\n## What are the different types of technical documentation out there?\n\nTechnical documentation comes in a variety of forms. The simplest method to distinguish between various forms of technical documentation is to determine for whom they are written. They may be broadly classified into two types: product documentation and process documentation.\n\nIn any case, products are not always self-explanatory. That is why we require technical documentation to provide us with all of the information we require about them.\n\n\n\n### Process oriented documentation\n\nSimply put, process oriented documentation details the method by which a product is developed. It is not concerned with the final result, but with the various processes, data, and events that contribute to its advancement and evolution.\n\nThis type of technical writing is typically kept internal and is of little value or interest to consumers or end users (save for external stakeholders having a vested interest in a product's development). It is beneficial since it denotes the many stages of a product's lifespan. This type of documentation is used for product management and project management teams as well as other corporate teams which need to initiate various processes and catalog documentation, such as HR and even development teams.\n\nProcess-oriented documentation can consist6 of Project proposals, which present objectives and timelines related to product development. Product requirements, which are compelling documents that describe essential facts and figures about a new product or service. Goals, user personas & stories, release details, roadmaps, wireframes & design details, risks & dependencies are common aspects.\n\nProcess oriented documentation can also consist of project plans, outlines, summaries, and charters.\n\nProject and product managers have an especially strong need for product and project roadmaps, so having documentation and plans to support this aspect of their workflow is essential for the progression of projects and the development of products.\n\nProject reporting and updates, as well as specifications of certain stages of processes within the product or project development, is another aspect of process-oriented documentation. This provides fantastic overviews of the many phases in your product's lifespan.\n\n### Product oriented Documentation\n\nThe next type of technical documentation is product-based documentation. Often known as user documentation, describes what a completed product is and how to use it. Rather than describing the development process, it emphasizes the finished result.\n\nThere are various different types of product oriented documentation, however, the main key types are user manuals, tutorials, installation guidelines, troubleshooting guides, Frequently Asked Questions, knowledge bases, wikis, and other learning resources: These types of documentation provide information about your product and help end users learn how to use it.\n\nUser experience documentation is another form of product oriented docs for SaaS companies. UX Documentation describes your product's user experience (UX). A list of all pertinent screenshots and user personas. his includes user personas, use cases, style guidelines, mock-ups, prototypes, wireframes, and any necessary screenshots.\n\nThe next sort of product documentation is release notes. This may be used for internal documentation to keep sales and marketing informed about SaaS product upgrades or to inform users and customers of new features and updates to a technical product.\n\n### Software Oriented Documentation\n\nWhether you're writing for users or developers, make sure your documentation is thorough and answers their queries. You'll save time answering the same questions over.\n\nSoftware documentation includes; API documentation software architecture design, documentation, and source code documentation. These documentations are very important for software teams to know how to build and structure certain technical platforms and products.  For developers it is essential to create documentation for software requirements, system documentation, code documentation, test plans and create other forms of documentation to increase and maintain effective teams.\n\n## What are the advantages of superb technical documentation?\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515378791036-0648a3ef77b2?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDU2fHxvbmxpbmUlMjBkb2N1bWVudGF0aW9ufGVufDB8fHx8MTYzMzM3MTIxMQ&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nExcellent technical documentation is important to the product development process for several reasons. Above all, it helps everyone realize their goals.\n\nWhat do we mean? If you're creating a product, your ultimate aim is for people to enjoy using it. As a consumer, your objective is to use a product successfully to solve a problem or offer a service. This is impossible if consumers don't comprehend or use a product.\n\nGreat technical documentation helps here. It equips consumers with product knowledge and helps them utilize it successfully, while also assisting product teams in their development process.\n\nIn order to ensure your technical documentation is well written the trick is to set up a proper process, workflow, and strategy to write quality technical documentation that is clear and decisively written. It must be simple to use and comprehend for its users. Otherwise, it won't assist everyone to accomplish their goals.\n\n### Docsie is a clear solution to help you write better documentation\n\nClear, high-quality, and easily accessible technical documentation is essential.

Not to worry; creating excellent technical documentation is a learned talent. To assist you in the meanwhile, we've broken down some straightforward methods for quickly producing good technical documentation.\n\n### 1. Conduct research\n\nLet's face it: it's difficult to generate good technical documentation unless you're completely clear about the material you're attempting to provide. If you already have examples, research, samples, and other data to work with, move on to step two.\n\nHowever, if you're beginning from scratch, it's critical that you conduct research. Meet with the team that will be responsible for the technical documentation in issue, discuss, and assign various research assignments to various team members.\n\nFor your research, it is a good idea to compile all the current information and documentation you have to work with.\n\nThe next step for your research is to consider what your technical documentation will be covering, your goals and objectives that you want to accomplish with your technical documentation.\n\nThen the next step is to list what sort of specific software, tools and style guides in the development of your technical documentation.

Technical documentation design\n\nThe substance of technical documentation is critical. Nonetheless, the appearance of your technical documentation is essential as well. A well-organized, visually appealing document will communicate information far more effectively than a disorganized tangle of documents.\n\nAs such, there are a few points to consider while designing your documentation. To begin, consider structure and navigation. Individuals often utilize technical documentation to locate particular information or a solution to an issue, and they must do so promptly to ensure the resource's effectiveness. As a result, the organization of your documentation is highly essential for this reason.\n\nIt's a good idea to categorize and sub-categorize your knowledge so that it can be readily accessed. This can be done through Docsie\u2019s articles within a Docsie Book. Articles will be displayed on the right hand side of every published documentation from Docsie:\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_iUtMpbO0NjOCAF31g/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/e8596395-59f7-8047-cc5e-74a54d5881c81.png)\n\nIt's also essential if your documentation includes a robust search feature and a dynamic table of contents that enables users to easily access the information they require. The most effective documentation software, such as Docsie, also has this functionality along with many others. \n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_IFCFzJGnWtVc2CzOv/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/eb564116-d7fa-ef24-1ddb-e5bcf7e3b4dd2.png)\n\nAdditionally, it's a good idea to start with a technical documentation skeleton. A skeleton layout of your technical documentation is easy to create and it will assist you in ensuring that you do not overlook any critical data that you wish to include in your technical documentation. We will discuss the skeleton of your technical documentation write-up on the step below. This will maintain the visual consistency and organization of all your material.\n\n### 3. Writing structure\n\nAt this point in the process, it is time to begin the real content production. Meet with the team responsible for your company's technical documentation and assemble all of the research conducted in step one. Then, based on each team member's abilities, you may allocate writing jobs to them.\n\nThe highest technical documentation starts with a skeleton which is the outline of the documentation.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_tYYBJlM0YkLJ2S48e/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/3ecefef2-02a7-686b-98d7-b7910dc0540d3.png)\n\nThe documentation must also be easy to read and follow along and it a good idea to let others in your team review the documentation and comment on it. This can be done easily with Docsie\u2019s commenting feature.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_BHCuBgK7PnFXEM5AF/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/b868c808-13f3-cd68-a5a9-e365ca42b1284.png)\n\nOnce everyone has completed a first draft of their technical documentation material, it is critical to review, evaluate, and review some more. It's a good idea to have at least two sets of eyes review each part of your documentation. This ensures that the material is not just clear, well-written, and grammatically accurate, but also effective for the intended audience.\n\nIf your technical documentation contains how-to instructions or steps to take, ensure that your team members test those steps and verify that they achieve what they are meant to.\n\n### 4. Test how users interact with your documentation\n\nYou may believe that you validated your paperwork throughout the review process, but this is not the case. After you've completed your technical documentation, it's critical to run it through a testing process to ensure that it's free of organizational flaws, confusing content, and usability difficulties.\n\nTo achieve this stage, you should seek out external users to conduct a review of your documentation. Allow them to read it, utilize it to assist them in performing the duties assigned, and offer you their candid comments. It is critical that your testers are external since they will see your documentation objectively and without bias, which will impact their evaluation. This can all be done with Docsie\u2019s web analytics. It allows you to see what your readers on focusing on in your documentation, receive feedback and also know what bothers them about the documentation and format of your technical docs.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_u6RAUGyvcgpYUsL7b/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/4873aa1d-2007-2f3c-33d0-9c4b471fcae75.png)\n\nOn Docsie\u2019s web analytics you can see a short video of how your readers are interacting with your technical documentation and use this information, paired with a rating done by the reader to optimize your documentation. It's very important to understand how to approach [customer feedback](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/7-golden-rules-to-successfully-approach-customer-feedback/) and integrate it into your technical documentation creation and workflow.\n\n### 5. Optimize the technical documentation with feedback\n\nConsider that you are now prepared to launch your brand-new technical documentation! After incorporating any feedback and comments gathered during the testing phase, you can update and republish your technical documentation for your users to use! This should give them a more wholesome documentation experience.\n\nNonetheless, your technical documentation journey does not end here. Technical documents are dynamic and are constantly updated and modified to reflect the products they cover. As such, it's a good idea to establish a protocol outlining what needs to be done when new information is added, changes are made, or general maintenance is performed.\n\nMany companies choose to implement maintenance schedule updates to their documentation. They establish specific dates for evaluating whether any changes are necessary, ensuring that all their information is always current and that modifications are never overlooked.\n\n## Quick tips to get started\n\n### Sign up with Docsie\n\nDocsie has a robust toolset to help you create amazing and appealing technical documentation.\n\n### Know your audience\n\nThere are several forms of technical documentation.

This will enable self-service, reduce your support workloads, and provide 24/7 real-time access to the information your customers need to enjoy and work within your product or service.\n\n<h2>10 Top Tips for User Guides and Documentation in Docsie</h2>\nBefore we start, do you have a way to store, write and host documentation?\n\nHead over to the [Docsie Onboarding](https://app.docsie.io/onboarding/) page for customer-centric collaboration, extensive embedding, tailored translations, and powerful publishing at your fingertips.\n\nNow you\u2019ve joined the club, let\u2019s jump into our 10 top tips!\n\n<h3>1 - Enrich Your User Guides With Media</h3>\nText, words, letters \u2013 we use them every day. Sadly, the written word cannot compare to the veracity of video or inspiration of images. \n\nWhen creating user documentation guides, read it from the user\u2019s perspective. Could this section be better explained in a GIF, embedded video or annotated image? If so, add one!\n\nYou can add images, embed videos and integrate iFrame content in Docsie. Give it a try!\n\n![Images, Videos and GIFs in Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_CdhFEVXwXaefNXxxg/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/e0eda1c6-284a-3e0f-5c43-0ff4099966d0BlogGIF10TipsforUserGuides.gif)\n\n<h3>2 - Create an Order, No Not the Jedi Kind!</h3>\nStep-by-step instructions are the pillar of cook books everywhere! When following a recipe, do you mix up your eggs with your flour? That\u2019s what you should do, and you know that because you follow the steps!\n\nAll jokes aside, ensure you run through any user guides with step-by-step instructions. If you follow those steps, do you actually get the result intended? Inaccurate instructions that do not achieve the intended result is a huge red flag for customers. Accurate instructions on the other hand instil trust, and provide value to customers and the business through information sharing.\n\nCreate an order using the numbered lists in Docsie, or with Docsie Book Articles to segment your documentation.\n \n ![Articles, Shelves and Workspaces in Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_O4Ux6ERzhyIS0eB1X/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/aa925138-ab48-e18b-ff33-50557a2897cfArticlesShelvesWorkspacesinDocsie.png)\n\n<h3>3 - Accommodate For All Reading Levels</h3>\nDo you assume that customers will know their JavaScript from your top tips? Using jargon and complex terminology is typically recommended in the context of technical user guides. For laypersons, however, the simpler the language \u2013 the better!\n\nMost readers just want to know how to do the thing, and repeat the thing. One approach is to deliver a complex, high-level concept on paper \u2013 then repeat again with a simplified version for laypersons. This caters to technical users and laypersons all at once, inking two pages with one pen.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence involves the algorithmic emulation of human intelligence in pursuit of productivity; artificial intelligence aims to get work done by matching human intelligence using computer code.\u201d \u2013 they both mean the same thing, but target different audiences.\n\nUse Docsie to create Shelves for laypersons, and Shelves for technical users. That way you can have Books to assist both audiences, with full hosting available through the Docsie Portal.\n \n![Complex Code Simplified for Laypersons in Docsie Example](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_cnLx3DDYwihXopx74/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/411ea34c-096b-3bf2-fde0-2f8fdaddd55aLaypersonSimplificationforDocsie.png)\n\n<h3>4 - Use Templates and Stop Staying Up Late!</h3>\nDo you rewrite every user guide from scratch? Instead, you should create templates with basic structuring and brand messaging, and build around this content.\n\nWriting from scratch takes time, effort and risks inconsistency if multiple writers are working within the same project. Templates are a great way to save time when writing, and drive greater consistency between pages. Trust is built on consistent messaging and value generation, which templates promote.\n\nClick \u2026More and select Templates in Docsie. Here, you can store templates and start new Books using the template as a source!\n\n ![Templates in Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_Hv9JSg74vQE1zgYjT/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/833830aa-871c-d3ba-19e7-0fbbba2adbfbTemplatesinDocsie.png)\n ![Live Template in the Docsie Editor](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_jdf9iWL3NXlFFePHx/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/2bfcea18-df94-30ff-4931-799345e4ae74Templates2inDocsie.png)\n\n<h3>5 - Write Fast, Iterate Often</h3>\nIn Agile software development, the mantra is to fail fast and iterate often. Applying that to user documentation guides, your staff should aim to write fast and iterate often.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing quality for speed. Instead, this allows for customer feedback and responses with less initial effort. This feedback can be leveraged in further user documentation guide iterations, and helps the business to become more customer-centric.\n\nDocsie Vocally elucidates reader feedback, with ratings and screen recordings to pinpoint the exact content they read. Give it a try as you write fast and iterate often!\n\n![Docsie Vocally Feedback View](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_8uO5DnYSHSsLteI2X/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/b9f841c9-1dde-5eee-c723-809f13df3255DocsieVocallyLivePreview.png) \n\n<h3>6 - Nested Knowledge With Internal Backlinks</h3>\nIs your user guide documentation backlinked with other pages? By adding links to relevant sections of documentation, you help readers to flesh out and understand your product or service on a conceptual level.\n\nWhen you refer to a specific feature or function, always add a link. Allow the reader to quickly access that information, rather than forcing them to search and load the page by themselves. Talking about account logins? Add a login URL to the \u201clog into your account\u201d text on your page, and every other page. Make your documentation convenient and navigable within the body text, rather than an endless library to sift through.\n\nDocsie allows user guide writers to create internal backlinks. Just highlight some text and click the \ud83d\udd87\ufe0f button in the Docsie Editor toolbar. Additionally, you can make links language- and version-agnostic with Relative object links .\n\n![Backlinking in Docsie With Object Reference Links](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_dclZdrsTWJrB8WETc/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/7d8c9e37-3aa6-580d-644b-0d7a8039fa89DocsieObjectLinksforBacklinking.png)\n\n<h3>7 - Brush Off the Cobwebs and Refresh Old Content</h3>\nDo you have old user guides and documentation visible online? If you have version 1.2 documentation published while your product is on version 1.3, your documentation is no longer relevant. Rather than publishing new documentation for each version, use Docsie Versioning.\n\nDocsie Versioning allows users to access historic and present documentation versions. As new versions are released, old versions are archived for redundancy purposes while being accessible from a drop-down menu. This is all on the same web page, making it easier for users to browse and find relevant information.\n\nSimilarly, if your top tips guide for 2020 is still published in 2021, update it! Change the name, refresh any citations and sources with updated research, and double-check the information is still relevant. Brush off the cobwebs and keep things evergreen; content can always be repurposed.\n\n ![Version Picker to Find Older Content in Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_OaCUumTVGz3CQ2ha2/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/4edbd225-b61b-0921-4f63-e55b3052ed28DocsieVersionsPickerMenu.png)\n\n<h3>8 - Miniaturize Tasks, Complete in Batches</h3>\nWhen writing, do you write the entire page in one go with zero pre-planning? Some of this boils down to personal preference for writers. By miniaturizing tasks, however, work can be completed faster and with more focus.\n\nCreate a simple structure with H1 and H2 tags and brief descriptions for each section. Use this when writing, and tackle individual sections rather than worrying about the whole page. This is referred to as an outline in the writing industry. The outline provides opportunity for feedback with editors before writing commences, and acts as a guiding framework as the writer writes.\n\nCreate a new Book in Docsie and add some basic headers and text for an outline. You can also add Tasks using the right-side menu, breaking work down into smaller batches as multiple team members collaborate on content. Version history means you can go back if a writer adds less-than-stellar content \u2013 perfect for writing fast and iterating often!\n\n ![Calendar for Task Assignees in Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_4JCx9FdXnyXu3quMX/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/d3468298-7bc2-7f51-7afe-2437f6321658TaskMiniaturizeCalendarDocsie.png)\n\n<h3>9 - A Table of Contents for More Content Readers</h3>\nWith complex and diverse user guide documentation, a wall of text can be intimidating for readers. This can be resolved with a comprehensive Table of Contents. Commonly used in encyclopaedias, this helps users identify and jump-to relevant information, while providing structure to a knowledge portal environment.\n\nDocsie Articles, Shelves and Workspaces work to create a Table of Contents. This will automatically show on the left-side of your knowledge portal \u2013 providing an easy way to navigate through your knowledge base. With this top tip, Docsie does it for you!\n\n![Table of Contents Auto-Generated by Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_oxDNcw0pA6rCZa3J7/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/35d48662-895e-b83f-c7c3-abb0ce6edd0dTableofContentsDocsie.png)\n \n\n<h3>10 - Master Your Subject</h3>\nIs your writer a subject expert? Similarly, is your writer resourceful and good at researching topics they may be unfamiliar with? Ultimately, despite all of our tips, the writer dictates the quality of your user documentation guides.\n\nThe more they understand your product, the more accurate their work will be. Allow writers the flexibility to test and break your product, as users may encounter similar issues. Better yet, walk your writer through a product demo with your sales team, and give them hands-on experience with the sales pipeline and messaging contained within. This again drives consistency, while turning your writers into users. Not all writers become users, but all users can become good writers with hands-on knowledge.\n\n\n\n<h2>Put These Tips into Practice in Docsie!</h2>\n\nThank you for reading our 10 top tips for better user guides.

WHY? Simply because technical communication skills are necessary for capturing information and assisting the audience in gaining a better understanding of the product or technology we are selling.\n\nWhile communication in the real world occurs through the use of words or expressions, technical communication occurs through the use of Technical Documentation in the virtual world!\n\nTechnical product documentation is created with the sole purpose of assisting the end user in comprehending the operation and architecture of the product or technology they are using. It's more of a detailed description of a product's nuts and bolts \u2013 a \"how-to-use\" manual for new employees, users, and anyone else who needs to know how it works!\n\nHowever, as straightforward as it sounds, technical documentation can be perplexing! The majority of technical documents contain multiple phases, ranging from \"How to use: If you're new and have limited experience\" to \"How to troubleshoot: In the event of a bug or error\"\n\nTherefore, if you're unsure where to begin, here's a comprehensive guide that will assist you in answering the what, why, and how of technical documentation, while also simplifying the process!\n\n### Let us begin!\n\nYou've come to the correct spot if you're new to product documentation and have never had to develop a product documentation specification.\n\nWhile you may have mastered the fundamentals of creating a product documentation specification, putting it into action requires thinking and a committed approach. Here is a guide on what you need to know and how to develop a flexible and proper product documentation specification.\n\nWe'll define product requirements and discuss its purpose, as well as provide numerous instances of product standards. You'll learn what to include in your product documentation, how to write them, from establishing a product description to modifying them based on customer input and limited user testing, and how to get your products started on the road to production or the software development process.\n\n## What Is the Purpose of Product Documentation Specifications?\n\nTo develop a product documentation specification, you must first have a good grasp of what the product is. A product documentation specification is a blueprint for the product documentation you're developing, detailing how it will appear to your customers, as well as its particular requirements and functionality of your product documentation, such as search capabilities, language changing abilities and many more. Additionally, it may include the persona or consumer for whom the product is being created but this mainly applies to products who are intended for certain age groups.\n\nThis product documentation specification should be extremely clear, easily accessible, and contain all of the information required by your design team and product team. Include as much detail as possible to ensure that your technical writing team understand what to write and your designing team understand the layout of your product documentation. A table or chart of written specifications will indicate where more information may be located. Bear in mind, however, that this is only the product documentation specification sheet - you may leave the specifics of detail oriented aspects of the product to be written within your product documentation to your team for later installments of work.\n\n## What Information Should a Product Documentation Specification Contain?\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506784881475-0e408bbca849?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHBsYW5uaW5nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyODE4OTkyNA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nEach product specification is built around technical requirements, engineering specifications, and other product-specific information. However, the following should be included in your product documentation as a minimum:\n\n**Summary: ** This is a high-level overview of the product. It begins with an overview of the product concept and concludes with a concise description of the product and its overall details. Additionally, it clarifies why the product was developed and its general purpose. The product description describes the finished product's appearance, and the features it will have.\n\n**Functional Specs: **This is a written aspects that defines your product's look and capabilities. Additionally, it should describe how people will engage with it. Its very important to be as detailed as possible in these explanations, and leaving nothing out.\n\n**Use case:** the product should state the use case of each function or feature of the product and how it benefits the end user. This could be deemed as more marketing level material. But if the usual has a user manual which also states the use case of each feature it will help them understand how it is to be used.\n\n**User Personas: **This section describes the target audience for which this product has been developed. It details the target demographic and the problems that the product will address. Knowing the product's targeted audience ensures that your work remains customer-centric. Also if your product has certain dangers that are not meant for children it is wise to state that in your product documentation.\n\n**Pictures/video: **each section should have necessary pictures or videos of your products in correlation with written information related to how the products is used. This will enhance your product documentation and the products use-cases.\n\n\n\n## How to Plan, Write, and Deliver Effective Technical Documentation\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1450101499163-c8848c66ca85?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHdyaXR0aW5nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyODE5MDAwOQ&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nTechnical documentation may get extremely sophisticated and complex! Thus, the critical thing is to ensure that your content remains current, accurate, and interesting for your audience by following these straightforward steps:\n\n\n\n### Be explicit about what you want your reader to do when you finish:\n\nTechnical documentation is entirely focused on the reader's following action. Express your purpose for every step and stage of your product documentation so that the user understands what they will be able to accomplish after reading. If you are clear on the document's end-user guides, writing your portion will be easier. And the more extensive your documentation the easier it will be for your readers to navigate through the information. Docsie also has many tools that will help with this, for instance our [search navigation ](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/plugins-extensions/)feature allows your users to search through your documentation and find information quickly!\n\n\n\n### Create an overview for the documentation:\n\nWithout a structured plan, it might be difficult to construct product documentation that flows well and is effective in reaching the main aim of your documentation criteria. As a result, it is strongly advised to start with a skeleton upon which your documentation can expand. Utilize headers, categories, sub-categories, and themes to properly arrange and group your materials. Docsie has many great  tools which allows you to create documentation quickly and effectively and it aims at creating dynamic product docs. \n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_sxziwEXY4iYSB0p2i/boo_Qj6raZoQQmjvdRxVs/19e9557e-cdec-2c24-9ee1-b82dff8c70f4image.png)\n\nWe have search capabilities, a well grafted organization for your documentation, as well as many other powerful features.\n\n### Define your target audience:\n\nIt is critical to understand the audience using your products in order to determine whether your documentation is directed at developers, employees, or users. This is to ensure that consumers understand the context, aims, and capabilities of the product or technology in order to assist you in adapting to your audience. And also if your audience is from a certain country outside the country of your headquarters then having [translated documentation](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-translating-technical-manuals-with-3-easy-steps/) is another factor you must consider.\n\n### Include drawings and captions in your content:\n\nIllustration or diagrams of a technical documentation must include various measurements which explain the dimension or aspects of your products. If you are demonstrating features of a digital SaaS product then having snippets of these features works wonders as long as you demonstrate what they do, and how they work.\n\nAdditionally, images help break up the monotony of words and provide interest to the paper. Captions can assist in putting product diagrams and drawings with clear directions into perspective.\n\n### Reread, edit and rewrite:\n\nGo over your technical documentation multiple times to ensure you haven't missed anything! Additionally, you may have your work edited by a coworker or supervisor to verify that you haven't missed anything. A review and modification mechanism would guarantee that the published material is accurate.\n\nDocsie has amazing tools that can help you create your product documentation, if you want to learn more about Docsie [Click Here](https://www.docsie.io/).\n\n", "header_image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557425955-df376b5903c8?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDU1fHx2aXNpb24lMjBib2FyZHxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjgxODk4Mjc&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080", "summary": "Technical documentation may get extremely sophisticated and complex!

Writers can create product documentation, edit documentation, and publish documentation to the web with a few taps on the keyboard and some simple clicks.

Pro Writing Aid\n\nFirst, we have Pro Writing Aid. This is a grammar, spelling, and sentence structuring tool that helps writers create product documentation.\n\nIf your (oops!) unlikely to remember &quot;you&#39;re&quot; vs &quot;your&quot; when writing, this tool catches errors and provides contextual recommendations on the fly.\n\nIt can also provide a reading grade level (e.g. Grade 13), sentence variety monitoring (short sentences followed by long sentences), and passive voice (&quot;I will do the work&quot; vs &quot;The work will be done by me&quot;).\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_sBDe8ADHXLhzOI7Bt/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/a876561b-106c-2150-6e2a-5d7a8522eba5ProWritingAidDocsieImage.png)\n\nGrammar, spelling, and sentence structuring is more important than many people give credit. When a customer sees bad grammar, spelling mistakes, and paragraph-long sentences \u2013 it makes them lose confidence in your product. For example, a high reading grade level for a product targeted to kids is counterproductive. Passive voice tends to waste screen real estate and feels roundabout for readers, whereas active voice is short, sweet, to the point.\n\nAdd Pro Writing Aid to your Docsie workflow; improve your words, inspire your customers.\n\n\n## 2. QuillBot\n\nParaphrasing is a common practice in content development, and this rings true when you create product documentation. Sadly, as much as we want to believe it, we weren&#39;t the first person to have that idea and put pen to paper!\n\nParaphrasing is as simple as saying the same thing with different words. QuillBot is an AI software tool that automatically paraphrases for you, avoiding plagiarism and its reputational or copyright-related consequences.\n\n&quot;How would one go about paraphrasing?&quot;\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_cwSR1syhFEDnzXYY6/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/de4f4ee5-a94a-5f35-9b0f-3f6b482f1766QuillBotDocsieImage.png)\n\nJust type your sentence, click &quot;Rephrase&quot;, and a paraphrased excerpt will appear on the right side. Neat, huh?\n\nConsider giving QuillBot a try along with Docsie if you repurpose content on the internet. We always recommend being original, QuillBot is simply a tool that automates originality.\n\n\n## 3. Snagit\n\nProduct documentation isn&#39;t just words\u2026 it needs images and artwork to illustrate the full picture (pun intended). By providing step-by-step instructions with accompanying images, users have greater certainty and confidence when following user product guides.\n\nOn Windows, the [Snipping Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b) is available. For Linux, [screenshots can be taken](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en) using (Shift/Alt)+PrintScreen keyboard shortcuts. On macOS, [this is done](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh26782/mac) with Shift+Command+5. Functionality is limited, however.\n\nNext on our list of software documentation tools is Snagit. It goes one step further as an all-in-one screen capture tool. Users can take entire display screenshots, windowed screenshots, or draw a screenshot capture zone. Snagit can also capture video and voice recordings, such as through a webcam. The best part is its editing functionality, enabling annotations like arrows and text in screenshots, or trimming and sound overlay for GIFs and video.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_SC6oDqX4HD1Py0agJ/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/46bf6408-a1ae-d79e-5924-8850700ee854SnagitDocsieExample.png)\n\nSimply put, Snagit is a screenshot, video editing, and communications solution built for product documentation writers. Consider giving it a try the next time you need images for your Docsie Books!\n\n\n## 4. Camtasia\n\nFrom the makers of Snagit (is this a movie trailer?) \u2013 next we have Camtasia!\n\nCamtasia is similar to Snagit, but focuses on screen recording and video editing. Users can take advantage of video templates with transitions and modern styles, and share templates with the team to streamline video creation workflows. The royalty-free Camtasia asset library adds visual flair without the copyright burden. Similar to Snagit, Camtasia supports annotations, device framing (full screen, windowed, draw an area), and dual-input audio recording (both microphone and system sound).\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_47zfmEreV6BA7FICb/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/f1407819-11cb-74ad-0b1c-66fdd48ee401CamtasiaDocsieExample.png)\n\nCamtasia on YouTube is so 2008, but it&#39;s not too late to start using this tool to create product documentation in Docsie. Give your docs some boom boom pow!\n\n\n## 5. Tableau\n\nData truly makes the modern world go round! Raw data, however, is difficult to understand for humans. Computers deal with raw data all the time.\n\nTableau takes raw data and converts it into beautiful visualizations, making it easier for all audiences to see and interpret patterns, trends, and other data insights. It supports a wide range of database types including relational databases (RDBMS), non-relational databases (non-RDBMS) and object-oriented databases (OODBMS) \u2013 leading to virtually unlimited data visualization potential.\n\nHere is an example Tableau visualization embedded in a Docsie Book.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_mgVz26JU76a3LADfX/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/8bee7e83-e25a-946d-bca9-08f5ad7588b4TableauforDocsieExample.png)\n\nTest this visualization yourself! Open Docsie, create product documentation (a Book), and select the Embed button in Docsie Editor. From here, paste the embed code and resize to fit your webpage (vizElement.style.width and vizElement.style.height attributes)\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/boo_uyETYF3HNzbtX0KaY/3a781b86-b930-fce7-2bdf-4bfa373b4243add_image_toolbar.png)\n\nEmbed Code (paste me!)\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/PhilippeTrounev/ccd08606d97d114a5efb972473e9bb37.js\"></script>\nIf your product documentation uses statistics and data, make it easier (and prettier) for users by using Tableau. Docsie supports Tableau embedding using iFrame technology, so give it a try!\n\n\n## 6. Draw.io\n\nAn electrician never attempts to rewire and reroute electrical cables without a schematic or diagram. With that in mind, users can learn the ins and outs of your product faster when you provide diagrams and flow charts.\n\nProduct documentation writers can use Draw.io to create flowcharts and diagrams. This software documentation tool provides templates and hundreds of assets to build engaging, visually pleasing charts. For example, with computer systems and network topology, diagrams and flowcharts elucidate system hierarchy and the flow of data. Do the same for your products by elucidating underlying workflows and functionality\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_jo79eJ1rF0UIUwNSA/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/e200dcc3-16f1-cd55-b228-1e5e90286f9fDrawioDocsieExample.png)\n\nDraw.io is another tool that supports iFrame embedding. Create product documentation, then embed directly in your Docsie docs! Alternatively, you can take a screenshot with tools like Snagit, but we recommend iFrame as edits to the chart will propagate automatically.\n\n## 7. Statista\n\nStatistics increase the authority of documentation. To include statistics, try Statista when you next create product documentation for comparisons against competitors, to illustrate market conditions and how your products tackle it, or just to add some oomph!\n\nStatista collects data across 170 industries in 150+ countries, making it one of the best digital sources of statistical data. All data is backed by peer-reviewed studies, and some data charts even show projections and forecasts.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_RUhjD6bkfd8IBFEKc/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/34ef079d-93ed-84f0-97fd-f3642905d6b8StatistaMainDocsieExample.png)\n\nStatista is great as it supports iFrame embedding, allowing you to embed graphs and charts in your Docsie documentation. These graphs and charts update over time, ensuring your statistics remain evergreen!\n\nCreate a Statista account and try embedding statistics in your next Docsie Book!\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_huVo7yXmIBx1LAGHf/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/e97c9506-cfdb-ab1f-828b-114c97dd0003StatistaAltDocsieExample.png)\n\n## 8. CodePen.io\n\nSoftware product documentation is a different beast than physical products. It includes high-level technical information, code snippets, and dependencies \u2013 especially when catering to the developer or engineering crowd instead of layperson users.\n\nA screenshot of JavaScript code offers little to developers and engineers reading your documentation, however. You can&#39;t Ctrl+C code if it&#39;s in an image! What they need is front-end code sandbox with build, test, and sharing functionality.\n\nIn a sea of software documentation tools, CodePen.io is particularly great for executing and illustrating sandboxed code.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_k5vSeT7kpOHl4UjHP/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/804fb7d8-95fe-777e-ea16-3ebea86bdcbdCodepenDocsieExample.gif)\n\nCode in CodePen executes in real-time on the page, showing exactly what your code does to users. This is great if your product supports custom code, as you can share a library of templated functionality for users to enjoy. Finally, the sandbox environment encourages experimentation, inspiring users to try new things and fully explore the limits of your product.\n\nEmbed code (paste me!)\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/PhilippeTrounev/4f4b59cdee9840abd42d95012c72655d.js\"></script>\n\n\nTry CodePen.io embedding in Docsie, and take advantage of our native code highlighting feature to help your developer users do more with your docs!\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_vvYoRQeiL3LCUVDAS/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/66d06474-e719-fcc0-7823-994eb242ba28CodeHighlightingDocsieExample.png)\n\n## 9. Doxygen\n\nA lesser-known tool, but helpful for developers and software documentation writers. Doxygen (not related to Docsie!) automatically creates software documentation by scanning through code and identifying parameters, attributes, comments and more.\n\nAn extension for Doxygen is CLion, which enables you to view Doxygen documentation outputs in real-time in the code editing view.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_2cPEUGCErPeWsXEGC/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/f892b701-5578-e660-2045-67bacdad9bf8DoxygenCLIONDocsieExample.png)\n\nHere is an example exploring the [iTunes COM Interface](http://www.joshkunz.com/iTunesControl/). Supply the source code, and the documentation writes itself!\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_rtD8sCQOi1D4bB7jZ/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/9a57672a-6b0c-65c9-d40c-117b548f0ebbDoxgenOutputDocsieExample.png)\n\nTry using Doxygen and copy the results into Docsie. Then, you can use our code highlighting plugin and other formatting options!\n\n## 10. Pixlr E\n\nWe&#39;ve already explored how to capture images with Snagit. What&#39;s missing is a powerful way to edit images on desktop and mobile. Adobe Photoshop is powerful, but the hardware requirements and licensing costs limit its use to designers, artists, and creative professionals.\n\nFor simpler documentation purposes, consider Pixlr E. This is a web-based product documentation tool with much of Photoshop&#39;s functionality, but without the need for installation on a device.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_DDQflhicLbRwoBg51/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/c25d3546-c21e-994c-793c-9ae51a701733PixlrEDocsieExample.png)\n\nYou can add text, lasso and copy pixels, blur, fill with color (using hex values or RGB color wheels), crop, brush, pen, liquify, auto-heal, add or remove layers and much more! Edited images are saved in the cloud ready to be accessed or shared; all you need is a modern browser.\n\nGive Pixlr E a try while taking screenshots! After, you can copy and paste exported images directly into Docsie!\n\n## 11. JotForm\n\nDocsie already has a feedback form for documentation \u2013 Docsie Vocally. This is only for reader feedback on Docsie Books, however, and not for general feedback.\n\nProduct documentation tools like JotForm allow you to create dynamic web forms and embed directly in Docsie Books. One example is for knowledge bases, where below each article you could include an IT Service Ticket form.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_PilAiIswkzAypwYPD/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/2712e505-5066-1206-005b-b41a3a907d28JotformDocsieExample.png)\n\nIntegration with ZenDesk means form responses can be automatically loaded into IT service desk ticketing software!\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_B0XeGkP8hxM7CC5rP/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/49b6ff57-5a3d-0dbe-ab79-13d2d5e41545JotformtwoDocsieExample.png)\n\nTry adding JotForms to your Docsie Books! Feedback forms are invaluable in pursuit of documentation excellence; you can&#39;t fix what you don&#39;t know!\n\n# Try These Tools in Docsie Today!\n\nEvery one of the product documentation tools listed above is compatible with Docsie!

If you wonder why this is, the answer is simple. It is due to the fact that technical communication skills are crucial to collect information and enable the audience to comprehend the product or technology more effectively.\n\nWhile communication in the actual world is made by speech, body language and emotion expressions, in the virtual world technical communication takes place through technical product documentation!\n\nThe only aim of technical product documentation is to facilitate the user's understanding of the working dynamics and architecture of a product and technology. It's more like a \"how to use\" handbook for your new workers, users/customers and anybody else who has to be aware of the working methods, a thorough description of the nut and bolts of a product!\n\nIt is the product managers duty to take upon himself/herself the responsibility of developing a team to create, manage, publish and maintain polished product documentation.\n\nI am sure every product manager has said or has heard the following in their department: \"Product documentation is a component of the Product Owner's obligations\"; \"Each development team should document their own apps\"; \"the feature has been deployed, has the manual been updated?\" or, much worse, \"there is an error in the technical documentation.\"\n\nClearly, technical product documentation might be a bit puzzling as straightforward as it seems! While individuals attempt to solve or argue about the lines in the preceding paragraph, manuals and tutorials deteriorate, which is detrimental to your \"product/company\" image.\n\nTo assist anyone experiencing similar issues, here are some procedures to implement to optimize your product documentation.\n\n## What is the purpose of product documentation?\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_AkCWDsRGayFUwrjU6/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/1945711f-8493-b2f6-a461-26ddae0b04acidea_3310390_1920.jpg)\n\nWhen you're talking about product documentation for a technological product or service, you're talking about the information that describes it and the data that pertains to it.\n\nTechnical documentation, or product documentation, is all about helping your audience and customers utilize, read, understand, and utilize your product. Most product documentations, of course, are produced in diverse areas including engineering, medical, information technology, and marketing.\n\nThe great technical product documentation helps your audience navigate your product and enable them to utilize it without complications.\n\nOne other consideration is that technical documentation is critical for customer assistance and contributes significantly to your company's branding and confidence. When they're most in need, users search for technical documentation. The audience uses your product to learn about the processes and deal with issues.\n\nThis means having thorough and comprehensive product documentation which is dynamic with search capabilities is very important\n\n\n\n## What are the different product documentation\n\nThis section allows you to see what kind of product documentation you need for your customers or clients.\n\nThere are many different product documentation types that meet the need of different types of use cases and user needs:\n\n**Product User documentation:** This consists of user manuals, how-to guides, tutorials, FAQs, release notes, and training manuals, as well as operating procedures.\n\n**Corporate documentation:** [Surveys show ](https://www.inc.com/david-finkel/why-policies-and-procedures-manuals-are-dead-and-what-you-should-replace-them-wi.html)that over 8 out of 10 companies, out of 1000 businesses surveyed use formal policies and procedural manuals. \n\nThere are many other corporate documentation which comprises of documentation referring to companies policies and procedures as stated in he research above, instructional manuals, technical practices, behavioral and ethical documentation. As well as legal documentation which could be password protected. Also companies structures, best practices, and procedures, as well as maintenance manuals\n\n**Developer Documentation:** this type of documentation provides instructions for software product development, functional specifications, technical specifications, documentation, and tools to assist with developer workflow.\n\nNow that we better understand the different types of technical and product documentation let us discuss what the first steps of a solid management of product documentation development process begins with.\n\n### Locate a head of product documentation development\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_PsI4RmXQikpEACQlf/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/eccf743b-f84f-655a-e8cb-52655df7bc4ccampaign_creators_gMsnXqILjp4_unsplash.jpg)\n\nA very typical issue is determining who should be in charge of the product documentation, not as someone who just updates it, but as someone who is accountable for the product's quality and success.\n\nWhile some businesses believe that each product owner and/or product manager is responsible for product documentation, as well as other departments such as development and support docs may also be entrusted with the responsibility of keeping user manuals, user guides and all facets of product documentation current and effective.\n\nThe development of product documentation has many moving parts but here we will point point two of them:\n\n1. Who understands how the product operates at all levels (this includes the product development and specifications teams as well).\n\n2. Those who receive input from customers who go through the product documentation and listen to their difficulties, feedback and concerns about understanding the product documentation at hand.\n\nThe first part helps us create the allotted product documentation with the knowledge at hand, and this gets sent out to the customer who in return give feedback and initiate the second processes which helps to optimize the documentation.\n\nSometimes these two points are not perfectly in place, and this produces situations in which the product documentation never receives the necessary attention.\n\nOne approach is to designate a person to be accountable for the, product documentation, product manuals and user guides \"performance.\" Consider a purchase order that has \"Product Documentation\" as his product. He is responsible for going through all of the company's teams, sketching out how each Product generates its guides and identifying the challenges associated with that process.\n\nThe intention is not for this product owner and product manager to be entirely responsible for generating and modifying manuals, but to assist individuals within each team on the with document management.\n\nThis individual should study how users interact with documents, offer ways to make updates more fluid, and gather feedback to determine how to enhance each product documentation and explainers with its intended audience.\n\nHaving someone in charge of all facets of product documentation, managing the workflow, and the different departments that are required to complete this documentation will increase productivity within the company, establish awareness and educating customers with knowledge portals about the product and over all streamline product comprehension.\n\n### Look at your product documentation as product itself.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_JdDBUtqTll6qYQgc9/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/cd6029ed-9933-9a5f-4007-c4d28888fa5ebram_naus_n8Qb1ZAkK88_unsplash.jpg)\n\nProducts exist to deliver a degree of value that meets or exceeds a customer's expectations. Based on [statistics generated by D2WorldWide](https://www.d2worldwide.com/product-documentation-why-do-customers-still-want-it-and-retailers-still-need-it/) 73.7% rate of people rate documentation more helpful than videos, packaging or salespeople when they are looking for information on products that they are considering on purchasing.\n\nConsider the factors that contribute to a product's attractiveness. There are several factors that can affect a product's attractiveness, but for the sake of this article, we will concentrate on three. They exceed expectations in terms of value; their usage generates satisfaction; and they are competitive.\n\nAdditionally, same concepts apply to good online product documentation. Product documents that go \"beyond the anticipated value\" illustrate not just how to use the specified item, but also offer solutions that the client is unaware of or does not feel are possible. It is always necessary to see how other companies initiate their product documentation in order to learn from their successes and mistakes.\n\nIt is meaningless to have a company that develops unique and high-quality software that is ahead of the competition if the developers and customers who integrate your technical product documents are unable to grasp them.\n\nConsider that the individual reading the product documentation may be unfamiliar with the range of possible solutions offered by the product or with the market (as is commonly the case with technical SaaS products), and so they must be \"educated\" about those solutions and various options related to the product.\n\nProduct documents whose \"usability generates satisfaction\" follow a logical reading pattern suited for their target audience. It serves no use to have the most thorough manual on the globe if it is a 500-page PDF or does not include a Code example and is not dynamically created with search capabilities, and other functions. Collect feedback from the users of your product document and your support personnel. They will ascertain the major areas of stress linked with the reported data.\n\nCompetitive product documentation are those that are continually updated using the most effective information exchange techniques. They have amazing features such as built in search capabilities, translations, different versions, embedded images, videos, and much more!\n\nEven if your integration guide is the best written of all technology businesses, it will lack the attraction without an added video, and images and codes which can be copy and pasted for ease of use for your tech savvy clients who purchase your technical SaaS products.\n\nIt is always necessary to see how other firms initiate their papers in order to learn from their successes and mistakes.\n\nIt is meaningless to have a company that develops unique and high-quality software that is ahead of the competition if the developers and customers who integrate your documents are unable to grasp them in all their entirety.\n\n**Product Documentation feedback**\n\nEffective technical product documentation enhances the end-user experience by polishing the process to understand products and diagnosing any problems with readily available written solutions. When customers trust and understand how to use your products your, they could come back to you in the future when the need arises.\n\n[New research made by SDL](https://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-writing/technical-product-information-impacts-brand-perception-893/) demonstrates that documentation's role in worldwide marketplaces is rising. [The research ](https://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-writing/technical-product-information-impacts-brand-perception-893/)shows that about 53% of buyers make purchases using technical literature before ever trying the product. Also, another compiled statistic from this research shows that 94% of buyers feel that having product information in one single location is helpful and useful. Because of this, each company places equal emphasis on product documentation as well as product development or testing these days.\n\nEven if the documentation has a designated owner who manages the documentation team, they have created product documentation that has been revised and assessed for improved usability, and has been properly updated, you continue to struggle to make your users and consumers comprehend your technical products. This might arise as a result of the users/reader's inability to comprehend how your documents are being read or the queries they are truly asking. This makes one of the most challenging aspects of document composition is putting oneself in the reader's shoes. After all, whomever produces the product documentation should have a solid understanding of the product.\n\nThis expertise may cause the writer to overlook things that are not so obvious to the average user. Typically, this occurs when something that is self-evident to people creating the product is not quite clear to those purchasing and using the product.\n\nThis can happen in a variety of ways:\n\n**Writing structure or form:** While this may appear to be a subjective word, even the manner in which a handbook is written can create confusion. It is critical to identify the sort of reader that reads the documentation; otherwise, words such as \"Developers prefer examples over descriptive text\" or \"Our documentation is not clear despite the presence of examples and visuals\" may occur.\n\n**Topic organized in manuals:** Occasionally, businesses operating in the same market develop a standardized documentation format. If your company guides do not adhere to it, the reader may have a sense of strangeness.\n\n**Excessive use of implicit terms:** When applied to a handbook, abbreviations may make little sense, even if the phrases are not acronyms. It's difficult to perceive, but some words, such as \"status\", \"id\", \"credentials\", and contain an implicit meaning disguised as explicit. Utilize particular designations, such as \"UserID,\" rather than \"UID.\"\n\n**Valid translation:** translation is a huge part of global reach. A lot of times companies create poorly translated user manuals and product documentation that does not match the culture of certain nations or simply the words do not translate the same way it would in English to that particular country. Understanding these subtle nuances can bring the product documentation a long way from unreadable information to a fully comprehensive and translated product documentation.\n\nTo avoid such situations, the aim is to develop a solution that gathers and analyses user feedback and navigation patterns.\n\nFeedback tools such as Vocally a Docsie feature is a great way to reive and evaluate navigation patters and survey how your customers are viewing your product documentation. [Learn the 7 golden rules of gathering feedback here.](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/7-golden-rules-to-successfully-approach-customer-feedback/)\n\nThis information is critical to update and optimize your user guides, user manuals and product documentation to create a more seamless experience for your customers to learn about your products. Nothing is more frustrating than introducing a new product and discovering an increase in Support requests due to poor manual instructions.\n\n## How to Write Comprehensive Product Documentation\n\nQuality product documentation is captivating, useful and powerful. I would argue that adept documentation is a necessary component of good product management. As much as product managers take a huge part in the development of products, a significant part of success is creating amazing polished product documentation that our customers can comprehend and use to further their knowledge about our products.\n\n\n\n### What is going on with most product documentation?\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_6UrbmSp116NpfVK1l/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/64a68ac0-4ef1-308c-ad6b-5ce4525f5301jeshoots_com__2vD8lIhdnw_unsplash.jpg)\n\nMany product managers are averse to drafting product documents. The product docs they are familiar with may not have traction with their customers unless more care is taken into making them appealing, easy to read and relate with.\n\nHowever, a lot of times companies do not take the care needed to create and craft amazing product documentation. Poor product documentation is written for the sole purpose of being written. It employs expansive phrases filled with vaguely acceptable thoughts and poor layout to discourage viewers from interacting with the material. A poor product documentation is created to shield the author from criticism and is a complete waste of everyone's time. And their customers dislike reading it because of this reason as well.\n\n### How do we fix this and write better product documentation which our customers will enjoy reading?\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_NSTKBpS5BKDoj224Y/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/d83ce28b-38c3-bb53-8a14-2e1212d0fc5cscott_graham_5fNmWej4tAA_unsplash.jpg)\n\nExcellent product documentation is written with the intention of being read. It is succinct. Good product documentation is well-formatted and can be read and comprehended by everyone in the company or customers in three minutes. It avoids jargon and either gives or refers to business-level viewpoint. An excellent product documentation spends time outlining specific use cases which the customers can understand and apply to the enhanced use of the product. It engages the reader and draws attention to underlying issues with well crafted solutions.\n\n### The potency of a well-written product documentation\n\nWhere there are small, medium, or big businesses, well-formatted technical product documents may save a lot of time and help employees work more productively. This is generally true of most product-based businesses, who spend a large percentage of their budgets on hiring technical writers and writing technical product documentation.\n\nIf your business employs more than two individuals to create product documentation, establishing a culture of good documentation is completely worthwhile. There are many reasons why you would want your team to create, manage and publish well-crafted product documentation but for the section below we will address how effective product documentation is a low-cost approach to improve customer experience.\n\n### Effective product documentation is a low-cost approach to improve customer experience\n\nSolid customer experience is the forefront of keeping and maintaining loyal customers. Most project managers are optimists \u2014 they get a concept, become enthusiastic, and then execute. While passion is admirable, and execution seems productive having a game plan before executing proper product documentation is vital.\n\nThe first steps after brainstorming a gameplan is initiating a design cycle and structure the product documentation content in such a way that it will be progressively easy for their customers to read. \n\nAlso, to gain feedback from their customers about their current documentation is a vital step needed in order to restructure the docs to match the customers needs. This way project managers can create, manage, maintain, publish and optimize their documentation with perception and automation. This is not a simple and miniscule task, and having amazing tools like [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)which automates a lot of the processes for making product documentation effective is quite essential for success.\n\nAttractive, engaging, and navigable technical documentation helps consumers learn the product in less time, which increases the likelihood that they will set up the product correctly and use it correctly.\n\nAll these strategies of creating well-polished product documentation will essentially lead to higher rated products, more favorable reviews, and more sales are all tied to one other; therefore, it goes without saying that the increased sales as a result.\n\n## How to create well-crafted product documentation\n\nHow to produce effective documentation and foster a culture where it is the standard? Writing effective documentation is challenging, and but there are many good features within [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)that can help seed up this process of making well crafted and dynamic product documentation portals. The following is a high-level summary of how we approach the issue.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_yl3vJ0vYDWgB1AnFf/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/7b97f8c4-af64-8ddc-c06b-93e6f28fea96dayne_topkin_y5_mFlLMwJk_unsplash.jpg)\n\n### Now lets get started:\n\n**Page limitations ensure readability.** Writing a decent document shouldn\u2019t be difficult to read and mentally process. Protracted, meandering phrases are frequently indicative of a lack of clarity. If the communication cannot be properly summarized on a single page, it is an indication that the product manager should probably go back and further break down the situation.\n\n**Formatting improves the quality**. A poorly structured product documentation increases the likelihood that the writer will wing it. Create a template with well-formatted sections, tables, and document headers. It's a one-time investment with high dividend potential.\n\n**Templates help you save time. **It's far easier to delete a section from a template than to remember to add one. It is not patronizing; rather, it is effective and time saving. Simple sections that remind the writer to begin with the broad background and to be specific about measurements or hazardous assumptions enable more precise writing and decision hierarchy.\n\n**Comment and assign tasks** There is no surer way to demotivate your staff from producing high-quality documentation than by failing to remark on them. Comments do not need to be very smart; rather, they should indicate involvement and serve as a model. While it is ideal to provide feedback digitally so that others in the company may benefit asynchronously from the conversation, a simple feature in Docsie which allows you to comment and collaborate with your team works product documentation team great!\n\nCheck out this blog to learn more about how Docsie helps with Product Documentation Collaboration\n\n**https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/collaboration-to-create-well-polished-product-documentation/**\n\n**Document types should be scalable to meet the demands of your company.** As more stakeholders get involved in the product development process, communication must be divided into several documents (particularly if the one-page 'conciseness' criteria is to be met). Docsie allows for a useful and sustainable solution for growing product documentation teams.\n\n## Use Docsie as a way to speed up awesome product documentation creation\n\nDocsie is a very handy platform that helps you with every aspect of product documentation and knowledge portal creation.

Writing the right stuff in the right way with your production team is vital and having the right tools to collaborate is key!\n\nAlthough the term \"collaboration\" has become somewhat of a clich\u00e9 in the business world, it is far from a cliche. Collaboration in the workplace leads to productive teams and this is especially the case for producing high-quality product documentation!\n\nCollaboration occurs when a group of people in a product documentation team, such as the product manager, product owner, technical writers, designers, developers, marketers, and other facets that create a well-rounded product documentation team joins forces to share their knowledge and skills in order to achieve a common goal which is to produce amazing and polished product documentation that their customers love to read.\n\nLet\u2019s face it! Whether you need to create product documentation, user guides, user manuals, or show any knowledge portal on your page, collaboration is essential to make sure all the pieces are connected in the right way. And therefore the company\u2019s product documentation outcome is heavily influenced by your ability to collaborate with others.\n\nLet's look at seven reasons why teamwork and collaboration are so critical in the development of product documentation.\n\n\n\n## Why collaboration is essential and beneficial in the creation of product documentation?\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fFdIWXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjYyOTExMjA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\n### It creates new communication avenues.\n\nWorking with new individuals\u2019 different sectors of a product management department with other departments inside your company opens avenues that would otherwise be closed. Finding innovative ways to interact and exchange information is critical to a company's success in producing useful product documentation that your customers will understand and comprehend. Different sources of information and input can be brought together by collaborating with various facets of the company in order to help develop useful product documentation knowledge for your customers. This is why collaboration should be used to create ties across departments whenever feasible.\n\nAccording to Mark Sanborn, \u201cIn teamwork, silence isn\u2019t golden, it\u2019s deadly.\u201d thus creating a more unified, open workplace for your different departments to communicate benefits everyone. Furthermore, it pulls everyone a little closer together and clarifies your organization's ultimate goal, and helps produce amazing product documentation.\n\n### Collaboration allows us to work more efficiently.\n\nWorking on your own has many benefits but when it comes to product documentation projects, the lack of information from various departments can be quite detrimental. We can concentrate only on one job without worrying about how much time we'll waste if we get sidetracked or how to assemble a team in time to meet a tight deadline. If the work at hand necessitates independence, then go for it. However, when it comes to product documentation, two heads or even more are better than one, especially when different concepts from the different departments combine together to make polished product documentation.\n\nA Stanford [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103114000420?via%3Dihub) discovered that even the perception of working in a collaborated setting can boost overall productivity and performance. [Forbes ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2017/06/22/new-study-finds-that-collaboration-drives-workplace-performance/?sh=1f9c6da63d02)also noted that in this study: \"Participants in the research who were primed to act collaboratively stuck at their task 64% longer than their solitary peers, whilst also reporting higher engagement levels, lower fatigue levels and a higher success rate.\"\n\nCollaboration, on the other hand, is just more efficient for creating product documentation. We must be ready to confess to ourselves that we will require assistance combining ideas and concepts to create polished product docs. It'll have to be a collaborative effort. This is when teamwork comes into play. It aids in the division of a large workload of many product documentation and/or user guides, the development of innovative solutions to create understandable and appealing product documentation that your customers will comprehend is the result of the big picture.\n\nAn organization that prioritizes collaboration to create amazing product documentation that their customers love to read as one of their core values will inevitably mainstream this way of working, resulting in a more efficient (and appealing) product documentation workflow.\n\n### Collaborating for product documentation with a high percentage of retention\n\nCollaboration appeals to prospective and existing workers because it provides the groundwork for a more open, connected, and engaged workplace\u2014perhaps even more so than businesses that are walled and isolated. Your employees will value an environment that prioritizes cooperation, and it will go a long way toward keeping them from searching for work elsewhere.\n\nAlso, when it comes to producing quality product documentation, that looks good, is informative, and fits what the customer is trying to learn about companies\u2019 products having the various facets of the company input their information to create this type of knowledge portal is very essential. Marketing can talk about what type of customers are being attracted to the company, what region of the world, and other data they acquired from their analytics and statistics. Product managers developing product documentation for their customers need the most collaborative avenues. They need to know information about the engineering fourth product, marketing and sales of the product, and feedback from customers. In order to create successful documentation, they need to collaborate with these teams and departments to know how the products work, what kind of customers match their product fit and use all this information\u2019s to help guide their technical writing teams, designing teams, and tech teams to create, produce, manager and publish effective product documentation.\n\nPeople value fostering connections, especially in the process of producing product documentation that is appealing and comprehensive to their customers and clients. We all want to work with individuals we can trust, who understand and respect our viewpoints, and who collaborate effectively with others, particularly those with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. Simply, collaboration allows this to happen.\n\n### Collaboration improves your company's morale.\n\nPeople will naturally trust each other more as links are formed across teams and departments, which will progressively raise the mood of the business as a whole. After all, if there is a lack of trust, bad synergy, and poor morale in an organization, it will fail. Working with people outside of your team or department on a regular basis is one of the most effective methods to establish trust.\n\nThis also works in reverse: the better your company's morale, the more likely your employees will feel at ease working with colleagues from different divisions. This is also appealing to high performers, who are increasingly seeking more open, participatory workplaces.\n\nCreate useful methods to collaborate and your teams will not only be productive but they will also take pride and joy in working with your organization.\n\n### Collaboration assists us in problem-solving.\n\nWhen you're stumped, what do you do? Assume you've made significant progress on your product documentation project, but you've hit a wall that appears to defy all attempts to overcome it. You have run out of ideas, development has come to a standstill, and your deadline for the completion of your product documentation is approaching quickly. Do you surrender?\n\nNo, of course not; you seek assistance or seek a different viewpoint. You might have a brainstorming/whiteboarding session with your team or solicit feedback from a coworker. To put it another way, you work with your product management team to address the challenge at hand. Product documentation projects that have been halted will begin to move ahead again when your team combines their knowledge, skills, and expertise, then hash out difficulties and discuss potential solutions.\n\nAccording to a [research study](https://www.adpri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/14215554/R0101_0718_v2_GE_ResearchReport.pdf) by ADP, the most quality engagement occur in teams with many possibilities for collaboration and exposure to novel problems.\n\nOn the other hand, collaboration does not have to be a last resort. Collaboration should be ingrained in the operations of your product management team. The more eyes that are on a project from the start, the easier it is to spot problems (and solve them effectively).\n\n### Collaboration allows individuals to learn from one another\n\nThis is key! Especially for the creation and development of product documentation.\n\nOne of the nicest aspects of working collaboratively with people who bring a variety of skill sets and backgrounds to the table is the opportunity to learn from one another's experiences and information they gathered from their various departments. Collaborating with team members or even different teams should be viewed as a learning opportunity to produce product documentation that your customers comprehend and enjoy reading, so make use of it.\n\nThis entails soliciting views and ideas, exchanging information, learning how your partners approach their part of the project and getting a better understanding of how they work. Learning from colleagues is not only a benefit of cooperation; it's also the first step in creating a learning and development-focused workplace culture.\n\nTeams that cooperate not only learn from one another\u2014their errors, achievements, failures, processes, and so on\u2014but they also develop a better knowledge of the other team's point of view. You get to hear their side of the story: their problems, priorities, and even how they think. Which will be incredibly useful when you work together in the future.\n\n### Some Reflections:\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595450547833-95af46d7c43a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDQ5fHx0aG91Z2h0fGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk5MDE0Mg&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nWith many facets and teams needed to work together to create and develop beautiful and polished user manuals, product documentation, and knowledge portals of any kind its highly essential to work as a team.\n\nMany collaborative technologies, such as an intranet, do this. They're meant to essentially open up your company so that all departments can connect with one another and keep track of what other teams are working on via news updates, announcements, events, and discussion channels, to name a few. But what about specific tools that cater to creating product documentation?\n\nHaving a cloud-based documentation creation platform that allows your team to collaborate effectively is very essential.  Using [Zoom ](https://zoom.us/)and other virtual video technologies are a great way to stay connected with remote teams and display changes or issues that arise when writing product documentation. \n\nAlso an interface like [Slack ](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/)or [Matermost ](https://mattermost.com/trial/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Google_Brand_NA&utm_adgroup=matermost&utm_term=matermost&utm_content=442324885582&gclid=Cj0KCQjwub-HBhCyARIsAPctr7zmyrCswx9f8GB_gVCUMAHiXE7_ZzThC2JNAkxc6htV7h_4UBG0IlcaAq4WEALw_wcB)is a great way to connect in a chat setting, it also allows to drag and drop items into organized chats which is awesome for collaborating with different teams.\n\nThat\u2019s why [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)has produced useful features to help you collaborate, and assign various tasks with your product documentation teams with these reasons in mind!\n\n## Foundational Concepts Of Successful Product Documentation Teams & Collaboration\n\nThe world is revamping the way we work on product documentation. Especially in terms of how we collaborate.\n\nThe majority of labor has grown increasingly team-based as organizations have gotten more global and complicated. Over the previous two decades, time spent by managers and workers in collaborative activities has increased by 50 percent or more, according to research published in[ Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload). This means that communication with various facets of the company happens on a consistent basis. \n\nIn addition, product documentation teams are larger, more varied, scattered and more specialized than ever before. While these product documentation teams might be quite efficient at solving the difficult challenges that many modern businesses confront, some of them still have issues implementing effective collaboration strategies.\n\nSo, how can employees today communicate effectively while negotiating the prevalent work structures and dynamics that obstruct efficient workplace collaboration? Let's start by talking about what collaboration is and how it is effectively implemented to increase productivity in product documentation development teams.\n\n### What does effective teamwork in the development of product documentation entail?\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558403194-611308249627?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fHRlYW1zfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNjI5MTIwNw&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nCollaboration is defined as when two or more individuals working together to develop or create anything. This can take place in person or electronically, due to the numerous communication technologies and cloud-based applications designed specifically for this purpose.\n\nWhile there are many various methods to develop and maintain a successful product documentation development team, the most successful ones usually have a few key characteristics. It's an environment where employees feel seen, heard, and free to express themselves and their ideas. Meetings and work sessions are handled efficiently by them. They've put in place standardized systems and collaborative procedures. Their teams are aware of the significance of effective communication with one another. Also, tech teams and technical writers, as well as product managers, have an effective place to see and track product documentation being written on products as well as user manuals for their products. \n\nThe ability to assign tasks and pin tasks and see what tasks need to be done in a managerial manner also adds a huge boost to the completion of product documentation deadlines and separating roles to help foster completion.\n\nMost significantly, these firms' management recognizes that effective workplace cooperation to develop effective, comprehensive, and polished product documentation benefits not just their staff, but also their customers who will better understand the use case of their products and how to use them.\n\n## Let\u2019s explore the advantages of Collaboration.\n\nEnsure that your team is working together efficiently in the office may appear to be a no-brainer.\n\nStill, bringing individuals from various backgrounds and, depending on the size and structure of your organization, different time zones together to work toward a shared objective is no easy task. However, the benefits of good workplace communication and cooperation far exceed the disadvantages.\n\n### Teams add more strength to effectively creating product documentation.\n\nWhat do some of the world's finest products have in common? They make an effort to build an effective product documentation team to educate their customers about the effectiveness of their products.  Whether a companies product is a non-tangible SaaS software or a tangible product having their team working toward a common objective not only instills a strong sense of purpose in team members, but it also allows them to fill in each other's skill gaps and split up tasks to play to everyone's strengths. Why is this important for product documentation? Product documentation has many facets to it. It has technical aspects; it has linguistic aspects as well as design. By combining the technical team, with the design team and technical writers who are all managed by the product manager and product owner you have a force to reckon with, and they can create amazing product documentation.\n\n### Collaborated product documentation teams are more skillful and knowledgeable.\n\nGood collaboration teams have the chance to acquire new skills from one another, which helps them to advance in their entire personal and professional growth. The act of collaborating forces individuals to think more critically, explain themselves more clearly, and learn more about their abilities, all of which can aid in the development of self-awareness and a better knowledge of their strengths and shortcomings as well as increase their understanding of the products being sold.\n\nProduct documentation team members that have a mix of different cultural views are more likely to achieve success. These include people who have lived in a variety of places and speak a variety of languages, as well as those who have strong roots in the region in which they are working and promoting their products.\n\nTranslating product documentation into various languages and then having a team who understands these languages is an effective way to polish documentation based on these factors to better reach the heart of customers who live abroad.\n\n### More creativity is needed to produce quality product documentation.\n\nMore and more businesses are forming teams that bring employees from all departments together to explore issues and come up with fresh ideas that will help create comprehensive and appealing product documentation that their customers love to read.\n\nNot only can efforts like these help organizations harness the talents of the various departments and views, but studies indicate that groups create quicker, see faults sooner, and come up with better solutions to issues than individuals working alone.\n\n### A more positive customer experience\n\nA well polished and versed documentation which can be viewed in different languages, and versions. Also, with all technical aspects of the documentation simply displayed in a methodical manner and presented appealingly to the customer will increase customers using products and understanding their use case. This can all be achieved with effective teams creating product documentation that jives with all aspects of their customers creating technically sound explanations, that are displayed well and expressed in different languages and to different cultures. This can only be accomplished by a strong team that works well together to communicate their ideas about the different facets of a product's production and customers' use cases.\n\nHappy customers who understand products usages, especially technical products, will give good reviews and essentially become loyal customers for the long hall and through word of mouth share their positive experience with others. This will essentially increase the revenue stream and foster a good reputation for the company.\n\n## 6 virtues for effective collaboration\n\nWhile the abilities listed above might help you collaborate effectively and create amazing product documentation, working well with others isn't only about what you do, but also the process in which you and your team implement them. The attitude with which you and your team approach collaboration may make all the difference in the world. Next time you find yourself in a situation where you need to collaborate with your team, keep these ideals in mind.\n\n### 1. First and foremost, efficacy\n\nMeetings are a very well pronounced necessity to collaboration, despite the fact that meetings are a necessary part of teamwork, they have received a poor name through time. As a matter of fact the Harvard Business Review stated in their research study that people send a ton of time in meetings, phone calls and responding to emails. The [research ](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload)states: \u201cHow much time do people spend in meetings, on the phone, and responding to e-mails? At many companies the proportion hovers around 80%, leaving employees little time for all the critical work they must complete on their own. \u201c\n\nAnd who hasn't spent an excessive amount of time at a meeting that seemed pointless? Several actions may be taken to transform your team into a high-performing machine of productivity. Having meetings well scheduled throughout the day via priority is a very useful way to set up meetings and tackling issues as they arise.\n\nAlso, a daily scrum helps to let everyone know what their tasks are and what issues they may be having as well as what they have accomplished the day before. The scrum is useful so that no one can step on each other\u2019s toes for tasks that need to be completed as well as allow everyone to share their ideas about how to help manage certain situations.\n\nAnother method is to ensure that each meeting or phone conference has an agenda and that specific goals are well defined.\n\nFinally, don't forget to assign action items to everyone participating in the product documentation project at the conclusion of every product documentation project that has been completed. This way the team may talk about strengths and weakens tat need to be worked on for the development of the next product documentation so that it runs more smoothly the next time around.\n\n### 2. Explicitness\n\nIt is uncommon for all members of a team to be on the same page from the start. Individuals naturally have their own priorities and interests. That is why it is critical to establish everyone's objectives and agendas in advance in order to develop a common denominator that will propel the project ahead.\n\n### 3. Positive Attitude\n\nSimply because a collaborative effort failed in the past does not mean that it will fail again. Shake off any residual hang-ups and embrace each group work scenario as a new beginning, with an open and optimistic mentality. Positivity is contagious just as much as negativity. However, positivity inspires growth, inspiration, and fosters good work habits which will essentially increase overall company morale. Be positive and reward positivity!\n\nOf course, we all have our off days, members who have their off days should be given space so that they can contemplate and transform their off day into a good day for the next meeting day. This is not a loss, but a win! Because one off day is better than an off week. And if one-off day can be recovered so that the next day the employee will be on point then that will work in the long run, and the employee will appreciate working for the team a lot more.\n\n### 4. Fostering Trust\n\nIndividuals must feel secure in giving and receiving real constructive criticism, feedback, be motivated by a shared purpose, and have the tools and chances to interact. This can only occur in a trusting atmosphere in which employees believe their colleagues and leaders are looking out for their best interests.\n\n### 5. Insight and emotional intelligence\n\nEach team member plays a critical role. Nonetheless, teamwork can break down when one or more team members believe they are being treated unfairly or that other team members are attempting to tear them down. The more you learn about your coworkers and have an understanding of how they operate and the problems they face, the more likely you are to collaborate successfully.\n\n### 6. Productivity\n\nThe most successful organizations have systems and processes in place that allow workers to refer to the schedule and duties of a project in order to have a clear knowledge of how their contributions impact the group. This way, if deadlines are missed or someone is not carrying their weight, the situation can be immediately handled.\n\nNow that we know what a good collaborative team looks like and we know how it should be structured let us take a deep dive into creating certain processes that will help foster an amazing collaborative and effective product documentation team!\n\n## 5 Powerful Processes To Creating An Effective Collaboration For Product Documentation Creation Team\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583506573326-f44ad9661e45?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGZpdmV8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjI2MjkxNjg5&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nIf you've ever worked on a product documentation project that didn't go as planned, you know that encouraging workplace cooperation is sometimes easier said than done. Perhaps your colleagues work remotely and are inaccessible. Or perhaps your organization is overly compartmentalized, and departments are unwilling to exchange knowledge.\n\nIf your company is experiencing difficulties with collaboration, one of the finest things you can do is concentrate on strengthening your soft skills. Believe us when we say that learning these five collaboration skills will make teamwork much easier and more successful.\n\n### 1. Communicate intent\n\nBefore you begin work or assignment, ensure that your goals are clear. Inform your teammates of your activities and establish reasonable expectations for when you will complete them\u2014and be sure to adhere to them. These examples of good work ethic will show and pave the way to how work is done within your company. be a good example and communicate your accomplished work and requirements.\n\nAdditionally, share any changes to the strategy you have established. If something unexpected occurs and you are unable to produce the expected outcomes, explain these adjustments to your product documentation development team.\n\nAgain, this is where having an all-in-one communications tool comes in handy. Also, if your product documentation team can video call and instant message one another from the same app, there is a greater likelihood that they will communicate promptly when an issue arises:\n\n### 2. Establishing objectives\n\nWhen working in a team, it is critical that everyone understands the project's goal and vision, as well as how success will be measured. Setting up goals and objectives should be done for small aspects of projects as well as large ones so that all objects can be tracked with deadlines and optimized to increase productivity.\n\nAlso, if someone is working hard and meets objectives on time or before the scheduled date make sure to reward them so that their hard work is appreciated.\n\nTransparency from all angles of creating and meeting deadlines and objectives, from the start fosters trust and helps guarantee that everyone is dedicated to succeeding and working toward a similar goal.\n\n### 3. Listening attentively\n\nWhen you work closely with people, you must pay close attention to each team member's ideas, criticism, and advice\u2014and answer with consideration and respect. That is the concept behind listening actively and with intent.\n\nWhile you may have your own views about how you want the product documentation project to proceed or who should do what, you must nevertheless consider your colleagues' perspectives. While you may not always agree with the conclusion, you must ultimately choose the group's needs and obligations over your personal desires.\n\n### 4. Solving problems\n\nOccasionally, situations arise, and individuals make errors. It occurs. When difficulties emerge, try to carefully assess the situation as a group without criticizing any particular individual. Rather than that, spend your efforts collaborating to discover answers. This contributes to the development of trust between team members and ensures that everyone feels comfortable speaking and being honest with one another, even if they make a mistake.\n\n### 5. Effective time management\n\nCollaborating with others requires you to be accountable not only to yourself but also to the members of your product documentation team who rely on you. Here's when time-management abilities come in handy. Prioritizing your tasks and scheduling them appropriately is critical to meeting deadlines and completing the job that your team is relying on you to perform.\n\n## Docsie offers many amazing tools for collaboration!\n\n### To see a video of these instructions watch this video here:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0tMPoEYAF-s\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe first thing you will see when you login to Docsie is Discussions, Changes- made on documentation projects and Notifications \u2013 which refer to tasks that are completed or are about to be completed.\n\nAs well as a toggle menu so you can choose which person these are related to in terms of the project:\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_8Rm1zP7hPCncODmL0/boo_gz9U5B838VHzHh2VU/e26a487c-b374-c9fd-58c0-134f1b783e09Snag_e143752.png)\n\nThis information is great to get you and your team started and on track for the day to meet deadlines and objects more diligently and effectively.

Meeting this expectation at times can be a legal obligation and also provides an \u2018open door\u2019 police to all nations to partake in learning from product documentation, user guides, and overall knowledge portals that companies have online.\n\nTranslating your material into a foreign language may provide consumers with a pleasant multilingual experience, increasing consumer trust in your business and, as a result, increasing revenue, as online users are more inclined to buy when accessing information in their own language.\n\nUsers visiting on your sites and reading your content will experience a sense of familiarity and resonate with your brand, giving your business a consistent competitive edge and driving it ahead of the competition in order to enter numerous markets.\n\n### Improving your documentation portals by translating them into a foreign language boosts SEO/SEM reach to other countries.\n\nIn today's digital world, Search Engine Marketing and Optimization is a major struggle, especially when it comes to the requirement for content to penetrate target markets and reach the intended audience.\n\nEffective multilingual SEO/SEM strategies can be accommodated by translating your product documentation and other content into various language combinations, the more popular and high-ranking the better, multiplying your chances of achieving higher rankings and better search results, which in turn generates more exposure for your brand. Having product documentation that is translated into various languages offers your company with a cutting edge of targeting countries that do not have access to similar physical or SaaS products but require a translated version of product documentation to learn and use such products.\n\n### The addition of a second (or more) language to a website's content can result in a considerable boost in traffic.\n\nIf you read [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117106531769704150), you may have come across Neil Patel, he is considered as one of the top 10 marketers in the world. In one of his [blogs](https://neilpatel.com/blog/translate-content-different-languages/), Neil claims that his traffic grew by 47% in only three weeks after he translated the whole content of his website into 82 different languages. Check out his blog, you can find a lot of other helpful tips.\n\nThis makes total sense since the reach of the content has become completely global and reach non-English speakers of the world. Based on a graph I found on [Languagenobar.com](Languagenobar.com ) English speakers only hold 26.8% of the entire world population. This means that if a company can translate their product documentation into Mandarin, Hindi/Urdu, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese and Punjabi that they will increase their reach by 58.4%. Which means they will reach over 4.3 billion potential customers. This is huge!\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_zRn1CEWo1gf6XujH2/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/9ca35a43-2134-b38c-05de-1f7019686a82worlds_top_languages_languagenobar_53c8ec5072196_w1500.jpg)\n\nSo based on these facts it is no surprise that companies are earnestly seeking for translation solutions to move their products into the larger global scope and increase revenue, and customer base.\n\n## Higher conversion rates can be achieved by translating into a foreign language.\n\n\u201c*If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart*\u201d said Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela was a spot about this. When your product documentation in the same tongue as your readers and they can't find any other information about similar products in their tongue, of course, they will become your loyal client and be won over, vs. going to your competitors.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_AFdqLObCzGpuQn9uY/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/77b47adc-04e1-d93d-8035-f19a98815a4bbackground_20870_1280.jpg)\n\nFor companies that provide products and services in more than one nation, writing multiple well-crafted technical user guides and user manuals is essential for globalization. No wonder: companies who interact in several languages and with multiple markets already know that knowing the local language and culture of each market is critical to competing worldwide and increasing their product reach. Nothing beats a translation partner that specializes in the topic to assist them in achieving that objective. In a BBC [article](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180403-inside-the-world-of-instruction-manuals), Roger Bridgeman, a former curator in the London Science Museum states: \u201cinstructions are there to compensate for the inabilities of machines by employing the abilities of users, and therefore tell you something about the state of both at the time they were produced.\u201d\n\nIt's also worth noting that technical manuals come with a wide range of items, ranging from industrial machinery to vehicles and technological devices and platforms. Because user guides and manuals are a means of communication that has a direct impact on the user's understanding of the product and, as a result, their experience with the purchased good, using the right tools to get user manuals translated should be approached as a very strategic decision within a company, as the quality of the translation is directly related to sales success and customer satisfaction.\n\nFurthermore, mistakes in a manual translation might have dire consequences for the client or customer who uses the items; such as causing accidents when handling or using the product, putting the user's life in danger. \n\nRegardless of the sort of communication breakdown and the potential consequence of a manual translation, one thing is certain: the firm responsible for the product's image will be tarnished. This is done by strategic steps in creating effective user manuals and guides and also translating them well.\n\nThis is a concern shared by professional translation companies, \n\nand as a result, they are prepared to implement a series of quality control stages throughout manual translation projects to ensure that information about a given product reaches the end consumer correctly and accurately in relation to the original content, achieving its goal\n\n### Are you interested in learning more about how these businesses operate? Then lets take a look at the steps below to see what a skilled translation processes are taken in order to accomplish well translated user manual and user guides:\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_8oLMBFJpm1n29PJnO/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/258bbf65-a0c5-a981-05fc-56bdf438257dtranslation_1092128_1920.jpg)\n\n### 1. Correct interpretation\n\nUser manual translation platforms such as [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)have a network of partners that includes the top linguists on the market. Thorough recruitment, screening, and selection procedure with linguists from all over the world are generally used to create this network. Companies such as [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/) often use the following procedures when selecting translators: translator selection and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 analysis; a test to assess the professional's proficiency in the translation source and target languages; and an examination of consistency in following instructions and meeting deadlines. Then, these experts, who are classified by nationality, language, and specialty, are evaluated on a regular basis based on their performance and the consistency of their supplied work. Attention! When selecting a translation partner, the quality of the translators' service must be carefully considered. As a result, do not be afraid to inquire about the qualifications of the agency's linguists in great detail. Also, lets consider language translation tools such as Docsie\u2019s Ghost translator. It is designed to translate user manuals and user guides quickly at a high effective rate. If the product manager and his team prepare user manuals for translation by simplifying the linguistics this Ghost Translator can be a very effective and user-friendly tool that works quickly to translate all documentation as well as create alternative versions for the end-user to read. We must consider this also as a viable option. We discuss more about this below.\n\n###  2.Extensive revisions to the project instructions \n\nFollowing the approval of the proposal, a product manager will be appointed to handle steps needed to initiate the translation of the user guides and manuals for their products. This specialist will be in charge of directing members of his team to handle user manual translations, as well as ensuring that the final file is delivered on the companies deadline. Validating the project's scope; elaborating guidelines for the professionals involved with the work; planning the translation in terms of scope, deadline; monitoring the processes, resources, and the evolution of the work; and interacting with the client to clear doubts and reports are some of the main responsibilities of a product manager.\n\n### 3. Meeting the agreed-upon date for the delivery of the translated user guides and manuals\n\nWorking on the assumption that the companies have a strict deadline to create, write, translate and maintain their documentation for their end uses platforms such as [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)offers a useful solution that minimizes risks by allowing companies to use our easy-to-use platform and help them take leaps and bounds in speeding up the process in which they translate and maintain there published user manuals. These precautionary steps include making a real-time backup of the documentation on [Docsie\u2019s ](https://www.docsie.io/)secure cloud-based platform and having their teams collaborate on various user manual translation projects effectively.\n\n## Docsie has a comprehensive Ghost Translator that allows you to translate all of your documentation, knowledge portals, user guides and product docs into different languages.\n\n## Check out this video to see how its done!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNwUeTIEskE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Here are the steps to translate your product documentation, user manuals and user guides:\n\nOnce you are logged in, press the shelf and book you want translated, in this case I wanted to translate my \"Quick install guide\":\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_5udCDdXWMkuLzAlZl/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/232a9cb5-33a9-3548-b511-1259ae5c1076image.png)\n\nWithin the opened book on the left hand side you will see two tabs.

Also, client information and other sensitive data must be secure, thus maintaining high levels of security is critical for any company. Document security threats can include:\n\n**\u00b7 Breach of security**\n\n**\u00b7 Data that isn't structured**\n\n**\u00b7 Unprotected Documentation**\n\n**\u00b7 Access to data that is not authorized**\n\nAll of this implies that you may be putting client information, customer databases, financial information, or even projects you and your teams are working on in danger.\n\nA lot of times companies work on documentation for their new products and they need this information secure to other company members or subcontractors which they collaborate with to complete certain aspects of a product that is not yet released to the public. Some of these products have pending patents and the need to secure them is the difference between a breach and a future release on a product.\n\nCollaboration and trust in your organization are more crucial than ever. This is becoming a commercial requirement as more clients expect that their providers be safe. While document security may seem intimidating, there are easy actions you can take to guarantee that nothing goes wrong.\n\n## Internal document security risks are the most prevalent:\n\n### 1. Prevent employees from falling prey to phishing scams.\n\nThe most serious internal danger is phishing emails. A phishing email is an email designed by a hacker who makes the email look like it is coming from a legitimate company associated with the employee's company and frequently has a link which the victim presses. In most cases, once the link is press this allows the hacker to have remote access to the employee's computer and thus they can penetrate it to get private information about the company and the future projects the company is working on trying to keep private until future release dates.\n\nIn a recent [study by North American](https://techaeris.com/2020/12/08/more-employees-clicking-phishing-emails), researchers found out that:\n\n* *\u201c67% of clickers (13.4% of overall users) submitting      their login credentials, also up substantially from 2019, when just 2% submitted their credentials.*\n\n* *The Public Sector and Transportation sectors struggled the most, posting a click rate of 28.4%.*\n\n* *The Education and Finance &  Insurance sectors performed considerably better than others, with click rates of 11.3% and 14.2%, respectively.*\n\n* *Users in North America struggled the most with the phishing simulation, posting a 25.5% click rate and an 18% overall credential submission rate. This means that a      little over 7 out of every 10 clickers willingly compromised their login      data.*\n\n* *Users in Europe exhibited lower click and submission rates of 17% and 11%, respectively.\u201d*\n\nThis is a strategy that some nefarious competition companies use to steal product ideas from under companies' noses. Phishing emails now account for about 90%-95% of all successful assaults globally. Hackers pose as trustworthy entities, such as suppliers, coworkers, or even clients, and request sensitive data. However, if you know how to detect them, you should be safe! Make sure you check the sender's email address, not simply his or her name. Incorrect or significantly modified logos, as well as spelling errors and strange emails associated with strangely written websites, are other red flags. Verify the email with your IT staff if you're not sure to avoid compromising any important data.\n\nPhishing emails can also be avoided if the company collaborates on writing product documentation that is password protected and secured by a platform such as [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/). It allows our customers to create product documentation in a collaboration format while still maintaining security measures and also adds the feature of sharing online documentation that is password protected. This is far safer than emailing such information because emails can be breached.\n\n### 2.  Managing documentations\n\nWhen access permissions to documents are provided on a need-to-have basis, product document security is at its finest. Password-protected new designs or new projects within product documents with limited access are an excellent approach to maintain a safe document environment. Electronic document management solutions such as Docsie have a lot of potentials. Docsie keeps track of documents and record any changes or other activities done to the document as well as the time and date which is digitally stamped. These trails must be constantly monitored for unusual behavior that might jeopardize product document security requirements.\n\nThis also brings up the problem of actual documents being left around the office for anyone to view. It's critical that this does not occur. Ensure that your coworkers properly delete important papers (rather than just binning them) or carefully store them if they must keep them. That is why keeping copies digitally online on a platform like Docsie is a really good alternative than having sensitive paperwork lying around in the office for social engineering hackers to stumble upon.\n\n### 3. Keep an eye out for shared devices\n\nAnother source of vulnerability for documentation security is shared devices such as printers and scanners. To reduce the risk, only authorized users should have access to these systems' network applications and resources. Use your current security architecture to protect printers using a password or smartcard-based authentication, reducing the need for additional passwords. Print management software may be used to keep papers in a print queue and keep track of all document activities.\n\nAccess to physical ports (USB, flash drive) is also commonly restricted to prevent someone from stealing your private papers or infecting your company's network.\n\n## Threats to patent-pending product document security from the outside can also be mitigated.\n\nDespite the fact that security precautions are in place, documents can be hacked. To prevent security breaches, we recommend following these best practices.\n\n### Keep your data safe.\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584433144859-1fc3ab64a957?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDl8fGRhdGElMjBzYWZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTc1MTk1Mw&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nA company's failure to use an appropriate encryption mechanism can be disastrous. It should go without saying that your company's anti-virus and spyware software is up to date.\n\nFurthermore, limiting Internet access across the enterprise minimizes the risk of employees falling prey to external phishing sites or downloading malware that can propagate throughout the corporation. When public wi-fi is the only option, its also a good idea utilizing a business VPN and creating other security measure on the Wi-Fi network.\n\n### Modify the document's format\n\nAccording to a 2021 [Thales Data Threat Report](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/en-gb/euro-data-threat-report#download-popup\n) , conducted by 451 researchers. They surveyed 2,600 executives in a range of industries and found that that 45% of US companies suffer from data breach at some point in their business life cycle. In 2019, data breach accounted for 65%. And even though from 2019 to this year the breach has been decreased, it still holds a huge problem for many businesses.\n\nSending documents as PDFs eliminates document format-related delays and transforms digital files into password-protected files with strong encryption and edit permission restrictions is a good way to send documentation back and forth. However, this is not practical if the documentation is product documentation that consistently needs to be altered. PDF does have security measures but using a platform such as Docsie which allows you to direct certain members of the company to manipulate and change documentations via the cloud in a secure way is much more productive. With Docsie you can set certain people to \u2018Admin\u2019, \u2019Editor\u2019, or just a \u2018Viewer\u2019 of certain documentation. This will reduce levels of breach because only certain people will have access to and be able to manipulate the documentation. Docsie also allows published documentation can also be password protected so you can have certain people who have the password view the documentation. These measures imply that the user manuals, policies or product guides can't be altered by just anybody other than the document's originator, or Editor, lowering the danger of forgery. When utilizing Word/PowerPoint formats, hackers are unable to retrieve the information of the document creator.\n\n### Choose your passwords carefully.\n\n### \n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_B726APThzDAuRDyNA/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/1a9a1224-122a-8dce-8663-9394359a3412cyber_security_3400657_1280.jpg)\n\nStated in a[ article written by Identity Force](https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2020-data-breaches), in December 10th of 2020, Spotify had their passwords reset after finding a software vulnerability that exposed their users' account information. Spotify claims \u201c*may have included email address, your preferred display name, password, gender, and date of birth only to certain business partners of Spotify.*\u201d\n\nThis goes to show that even top SaaS companies have weaknesses with password penetration. This is why it is always important to never forget to maintain quality passwords! To prevent changing passwords every three months, our system administrators at Docsie advocate having a strong password policy along with MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication). It's also a good idea to remind your coworkers of some fundamental password rules:\n\nPasswords should never be written on sticky notes and then \u201chidden\u201d under your keyboards.\n\n**Here are a few key notes on making a good password:**\n\n1. Do not use the same password for several accounts and platforms.\n\n2. The more time you have, the better! Check the strength of your password document at HowSecureismyPassword.net. -security-use-strong-password\n\n3. It's critical to make sure that new employees go through an interesting and instructive internal training session that covers both internal and external threats. Employers frequently address this with a simple e-learning programmed or worksheet, but this is not always sufficient to ensure that staff are aware of the hazard.\n\n### Docsie helps with all facets of security with your product documentation development, collaboration, and publishing with the ability to password protect your documentation.\n\n### Here is a short video on how Docsie helps with security as well as creation password protected product documentation:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7R3WXOnXPE8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nLets start with how Docsie\u2019s internal platform helps us to maintain security over how documents are written. As I mentioned above, here are many instances where documents related to new products need to be written and safely protected and secure. These products may not yet be patent pending but the product documentation writing process is still underway. One way Docsie helps with security in regard to this matter is by making certain that all documentation is written, send and managed only by certain parties with certain responsibilities.\n\nDocsie allows the owner of a workspace to set up \u201cAdmins\u201d (who can create new books and shelves) \u201cViewers\u201d (who can only view a workspace and not edit or write on top of projects) \u201cEditors\u201d who can only edit books and \u201cowners\u201d who have all the power to transfers all Docsies capabilities and set members to the various positions within the Docsie project.\n\nThis is very useful because it show who is working on a given project and what they are doing with it, as well as limited those who should not be partaking in certain aspects of the project.\n\nThis ability is accessible very simple with Docsie. At the top right corner where you see three dots click on your Username:\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ZjgXPtSl0RlVBr98x/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/cf10ca9d-cf81-cb56-4ce1-abe88f9919e9Snag_3dc21e.png)\n\nOnce you are in the Profile and Setting dashboard, then click Users and it should open the Workspace User Management dashboard:\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_LusOK9N4cYs62tmgO/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/2a3683cc-6afa-d6a7-f19b-cf810211a89cSnag_3e7ce3.png)\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_0OL56vieZqzTE9UQB/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/72423478-b544-adeb-61e0-15929a28a298Snag_3ef5cc.png)\n\nNow within this dashboard you have the ability to invite new users, change their \u201cRoles\u201d to \u201cViewer, Editor, Admin\u201d and delete users who are no longer working on a certain project.\n\nNow to add another level of security. All of Docsie\u2019s users who are working on a certain project are will be tracked through our time stamp. This is highly useful for tracking who was editing a documentation, what revisions they made, and what changes they have done. This will tell us who and when someone had interactions with a certain product documentation project. Any form of tracking is highly useful for security purposes because it shares information about who and when someone had access to certain documentation.\n\nIt is easily accessible as well. Once book is open click on the circular clock image on the top right corner:\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ZFC7kIcr91dH4Oglw/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/2edc1be5-9f18-dc5a-5205-9e769d5fb8eaSnag_3f7c90.png)\n\nThis will reveal a drop down on the right hand side of who and when someone worked on a specific documentation:\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_GcHe7Y8M7cLwB7RGd/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/86ed6131-5980-e307-d00a-8479b5f9f528Snag_3fdb4a.png)\n\n\n\n## Password protecting documentation with Docsie:\n\nDocsie also allows us to password protect docs.\n\nThere are two ways to do so. By clicking in the three dots near your shelf or books.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_9tB3mDhl0WPwFiaht/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/160f814a-13bd-09f0-3e2c-a8b18bfbbab1Snag_4077e8.png)\n\nThis will open a settings tab, in which you need to click properties in order to access the password creation dashboard.\n\nNote: if you click on the three dots next to your shelf then it will password protect all the books within your shelf. However if you click on the three dots and then properties within your book then it will password protect the book you have clicked properties to only!\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Lo7CM1IekNCDS5rTa/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/17693cea-41e7-2b78-ee77-517b59923cd2Snag_40d605.png)\n\nAfter you have clicked properties it will open up this dashboard then click \u201cMore options\u201d:\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_zN9LFzvG5tT00uXjc/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/6949063f-c31b-6650-ab89-bc6e8829f1f5Snag_416f19.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_d5dR2xrdTlISl1rzV/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/9ce603b3-85e5-1711-24a2-0d290e77f887Snag_418cc3.png)\n\nOnce you have clicked more options it will open your entire password dashboard. Now you can type in your password for the book or shelf and enable the password protection. Done! Your books and/shelf will be completely password protected and only those with the password can access it.\n\nTo learn more please visit us at help.docsie.io or send us an email at [hello@docsie.io](mailto:hello@docsie.io)\n\n\n\n", "header_image": "https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_CsW4uVzecwjM1qOdJ/boo_EO7v3CdNAEEno7FUQ/5d9415af-0cf5-4abd-a7f5-d167d0b83a4amatthew_henry_fPxOowbR6ls_unsplash_(1).jpg", "summary": "These are tips to ensure that the creation of documentation for patent pending products will be secure and protected.", "publish_date": "July 08, 2021", "categories": ["Product Documentation", "Product Management", "Documentation Portals", "Product Updates", "Best Practices", "Cybersecurity"], "status": 1, "path": "/blog/articles/ensure-security-with-new-product-documentation", "slug": "ensure-security-with-new-product-documentation", "previous": {"link": "../7-golden-rules-to-successfully-approach-customer-feedback", "title": "7 Golden Rules To Successfully Approach Customer Feedback"}, "next": {"link": "../everything-you-need-to-know-about-translating-technical-manuals-with-3-easy-steps", "title": "Everything you need to know about translating technical manuals with 3 easy steps!"}}, {"title": "7 Golden Rules To Successfully Approach Customer Feedback", "author_name": "Tal F.", "author_email": "tal@docsie.io", "author_info": "VP of Customer Success @ Docsie.io", "author_image": " https://cdn.docsie.io/user_profiles/15/logo_logo_QmXrbijvL0L2hFKNm6Q25DtjahujKdB6nu4pqBlLBgvtT.png", "author_social": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tal-frenkel-1363b2209/", "markdown": "![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516321318423-f06f85e504b3?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDQ0fHxsaXN0ZW4lMjB0byUyMGN1c3RvbWVyfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTYwMTA3Mg&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nCustomer feedback is the forefront creating and optimizing appealing product documentation that your customers understand, and use to aid them with the use of your SaaS or physical products.\n\nA lot of times companies are scared to knowing what their customers truly think about their documentation and this leads to a roadblock in finding out what their customers truly think about their product docs.\n\nWhy is this important? Why do we need to learn about what our customers feel about our product documentation?\n\nIf you own and operate your own company I'm sure you go out of your way to delight your consumers, to meet their demands, and to keep them loyal to your business. But how can you be certain that your efforts will yield the intended outcomes? You will never be able to provide your customers with the ideal product documentation experience if you do not try to find out what they think about your service. Their feedback on their experiences perusing and browsing your online documentation with your brand products is valuable information that you can utilize to better tailor your product documentation to meet their demands.\n\nYou may use client feedback to your advantage in a variety of ways. In this article, I'll try to illustrate why gathering client feedback about your documentation, whether prompted or unprompted, is critical for managing customer happiness and loyalty, customer retention, product and service improvement, and many other aspects of your organization. Continue reading to learn about the advantages of product documentation feedback.\n\nWhat does product documentation feedback entail?\n\nCustomer feedback is information supplied by customers regarding their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a product documemntation, user manual and any online documentation provided to the customer by the company. Their feedback can help you improve the client experience and tailor your activities to their demands. This information may be gathered through various types of surveys (prompted feedback), but you can also locate and collect unprompted feedback from your clients by employing Internet monitoring technologies, such as Vocally \u2013 a feature within Docsie that allows you to observe how your customers react with your online published documentation. Both sources are necessary for obtaining a complete picture of how your clients view your brand.\n\nTop-performing organizations recognize the importance of consumer input in their operations. They pay attention to their clients' voices on a regular basis. They not only look for thoughts that clients post on social media and reviews that they offer on feedback-gathering websites (such as TripAdvisor), but they also ask for input directly through various types of questionnaires. If you want to keep ahead of the competition, you must always pay attention to consumer feedback, whether favorable or bad, prompted or unprompted.\n\n## Why is it important?\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1531537571171-a707bf2683da?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGxpc3RlbmluZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjU2MDEwMTg&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nMany SaaS and engineering products have a variety of user guides, user manuals and other version of product documentation which they provide to their customers. This documentation can be translated in to various languages, and have many versions. So why is it important to know what your customers are thinking when they are looking at your companies product documentation? Simple. Product documentation are designed to explain how your product works, and if this explanation is not comprehensible to your clients it could lead to churn, and clients who are annoyed with reading your documentation. Feelback helps to narrow the gap between their misunderstanding and optimizing the documentation so that they can comprehend the material in a more comprehensive manner. This essentially makes your customers happier because now they understand how to use the product documentation as it was indented and it instills a trust in using your brand, which shapes your companies reputation in a positive way.\n\nSecondly, knowing feedback can deliver the product manager, product owner, technical writer and even tech team with information that they can use to help improve the product documentation outlay, as well as content to increase and optimize for higher comprehension. This is always the goal when publishing product documentation.\n\nThe following are the top seven reasons why client feedback is critical in the business world.\n\n### 1.  Customer input aids in the development of better products documentation.\n\nYou presumably have an idea of client demands when you first bring a new product, brand, or service to the market. Market research conducted before to introduction may help you determine whether or not potential clients would be willing to purchase it, as well as provide you with suggestions on how to enhance it. After launching your products you now need to make suitable user guides, online product documentation by sharing your knowledge portal with your clients online. You hire a technical writer to write information about your product. A translator to translate it and get your tech team to display it online. However, you will only hear about all of the benefits, faults, and their actual experience after your consumers have used your products in correlation with your product documentation and provided you and your team with the necessary feedback.\n\nThis customer feedback provides insight into what aspects of your product documentations are performing effectively and what changes might be made to improve the experience. Your professional knowledge may be the finest in the industry in which your firm works, but consumer insights will always be more useful to finely polished product documentation that your customers will understand. Because you are really close to your products its good to get their feedback assists you in ensuring that the final product documentation meets their expectations, solves their issues, clears up any misunderstandings the products has and meets their requirements.\n\n### 2.  Client feedback aids in the evaluation of customer satisfaction level.\n\nCustomer loyalty and happiness are important factors in determining a company's financial performance. It's connected to a slew of advantages, including improved market share, cheaper expenses, and more income. A number of studies have found a strong link between customer satisfaction and corporate performance. As a result, there's no doubt that you want to ensure that your customers are satisfied with your product documentation and understand how to use your products effectively. Getting their feedback is, of course, the greatest method to see if you've met their expectations. You can simply assess the degree of satisfaction and, as a result, anticipate your company's financial situation in the future by using rating-based inquiries.\n\nNPS is one of the most accurate techniques for measuring, managing, and improving customer satisfaction that has been used by many organizations. The statistic is based on a single question that asks if a client is likely to suggest a brand to a friend. The loyalty questions provide response possibilities ranging from 0 to 5, with 0 signifying highly negative and 5 reflecting extremely positive. Because this technique is both easy and ubiquitous, it may be used in customer satisfaction management by any company. Vocally uses this rating as well, and additionally allows our clients to recorded videos of how their customers use their documentation. This information is highly essential and also gives companies the cutting edge in analyzing their customers feedback and delivering on future optimizations of the product documentation.\n\n### 3.  Collecting client feedback demonstrates that you care about what they have to say.\n\nBy soliciting comments from your customers, you demonstrate that you value their input. You include them in the development of your company, products and product documentation/user guides so that they feel more connected to it. You may strengthen your relationship with them by listening to their voice. This is the most effective approach to recruit important brand ambassadors who will help you spread good word of mouth. And I'm sure you're aware that relying on their recommendations is probably the most successful and cost-efficient approach to gain new consumers and increase your trustworthiness in the eyes of present and future customers.\n\nPeople enjoy it when you inquire about their satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) with the way your company formulated your product documentation. It demonstrates that you appreciate their viewpoint and are here to help them, not the other way around. They believe that your main purpose as product documentation is to solve their misunderstandings, and helps educate them on how to use your products effectively which is a proper approach to customer retention.\n\n### 4.  Customer input aids in the creation of the greatest possible customer experience.\n\nToday marketing is strongly influenced by people's interactions with products, services, and brands. People do not purchase brand name items just because they are excellent. They seek for quality customer service, user experience and over all good understanding of the products specifications and use case which matches their needs. They purchase the confidence to push their boundaries farther. Clients will remain loyal to your brand if you focus on offering the finest customer experience at every touchpoint. And, of course, the most effective approach to provide customers with a wonderful experience is to ask them what they appreciate about your products documentation which demonstrates the uses of your products and what they think may be improved. This is even more so for SaaS products which have many facets and technical aspects. The more educated your customers are the more they will understand the uses or your products and the more they will want to stick around and maintain loyalty.\n\n### 5.  Customer feedback aids in the retention of customers.\n\nCustomers that are happy with your service will continue to do business with you. Unsatisfied customers who don\u2019t understand your product documentation, and consistently get confused with how to use your product will ultimately seek out a better option to your company. Customer feedback may help you figure out where your customers are getting confused with your product documentation and what made them happy with the knowledge portal of your products and identify areas where you can improve. You can always maintain your finger on the pulse if you ask for comments on a frequent basis. When a disgruntled consumer expresses their dissatisfaction, you can respond quickly and find a solution to their problem. This is an ideal time to reclaim a customer and perhaps improve their degree of loyalty. In many situations, a dissatisfied client who had an issue with your products, services and or user guides which explain them but was promptly resolved displays greater loyalty to your brand than a consumer who has never been dissatisfied with your products or services.\n\n### 6.  Customer feedback is a trustworthy source of data for other consumers.\n\nIn the world of marketing, gathering analytics and feedback it is highly essential to collect useful data and information to opt for optimizations and continue increase retention and bringdown churning rates. Consumers no longer believe advertising or expert advise in the age of social media. These days, the opinions of other consumers who have utilized a product or service are a more credible source of information. When you are looking for a place to stay in a city you are visiting or a beautiful new restaurant to dine with friends, you check reviews first. When you want to buy new shoes, you ask for advice on Facebook or read a review on a reputable site. Reviews apply to any business, especially SaaS products. Many businesses now include a review system as part of their services and products. This ensures that not only their brands can be shaped by the reviewers but also that they can work hard to gain trust of new customers and attempt to claim them for the long hall. Customer feedback is just as essential to your business as it is to other customers, so make sure you and your clients can easily access comments and evaluations.\n\n### 7.  Customer feedback provides you with information that assists you in making company decisions.\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607000975509-de2f74eb8d36?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHx0cnVzdHxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjU2MDEyNTY&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nIn a highly competitive market, business choices based on wild guesses have no place. Successful business owners collect and manage a certain type of information that aids in the development of future initiatives. Only in this way will they be able to tailor their products and services to precisely meet the demands of their customers.\n\nCustomer feedback is one of the most dependable sources of concrete data that can be utilised to make business choices. Customer insights can assist you gain a better understanding of your clientele and their demands. Take their advice into account, and you'll be able to figure out where you should put your money to obtain the most return on investment. You could find that, in your situation, more product development isn't essential, and that instead, you should focus on advertising your brand to gain more visibility. Customer feedback is a wonderful source of such information, but you must learn how to listen to it and turn it into meaningful business insights.\n\nVocally (a Docsie powered feature) allows you to put your clients and customers at the core of your business and regard their input as the most significant source of information in your organization so that you can keep on top of things. Your customers are the ones that use your products and services; therefore they are the best people to tell you how you can make them even happier. Never disregard the sound of their voice. If you fail to satisfy their expectations, your customers will go for another firm that can do it better. Customer feedback should be used at all levels of your organization and in all divisions. Insights will aid in the development of your goods, as well as the improvement of customer service and the management of client happiness. Customer feedback ensures that your customers will stick with you, remain loyal to your brand, and, as a result, promote great word-of-mouth about you. Having committed brand ambassadors is priceless when it comes to growing your business!\n\nKeep in mind that consumer comments may be found anywhere. Learn how to gather it with the help of Vocally.

In this article i will guide you on the steps you need to take to get started on customizing your Docsie portal. Please keep in mind that i am not a professional developer, or designer and know that your tech team can use these tools to create beautifully fashioned Docsie portal far better then I can. This is merely a step by step guide on how to get them started!\n\n## STEP 1\n\nThe first step is to get your line of code. He is how it is done. Find your account on the top right corner where there are three dots and click it. It will take you to Docsie's settings dashboard.\n\n## STEP 2\n\nNext, click on 'Deployment' button on the left hand side.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_UNFgmrrV4LJRPPcLD/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/f551ad37-a3a0-78bb-f97a-1246d5d57899Snag_1113a5f7.png)\n\nOnce you are in the deployment settings now you the ability to create a knowledge portal via Docsie cloud, or to create a knowledge portal via your own companies website by summoning a line of code in which you can add to your HTML and begin the styling process. This is done simply by clicking 'Configure a new deployment +'\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_66sDikYE16JfYewXU/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/4a8b6dd2-03d2-5d7a-837d-e3afdbe66900Snag_11161d31.png)\n\n## STEP 3\n\nNext click on the tab that says 'Custom deployment' type your website within 'Deployment URL' and then click 'Create web portal'.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_6CGgetG9GizkqY87p/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/4b102fcb-a424-8966-1f92-59b56e14241dimage.png)\n\nOnce that is done, make sure to scroll down and find your portal at the bottom of the list of portals and then click 'Get deployment script.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_el02yIrEUA3rf28CG/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/a64fc5d5-4e2c-9c6a-8325-6ed88a291db3Snag_1119813c.png)\n\n\n\n## STEP 4\n\nNow copy your script and lets jump onto Visual Studio Code!\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_a3ExYoQ3yZSLnkf4y/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/1a26f697-45e9-b0c4-53d2-8ad808b8d49fSnag_111a44da.png)\n\nIf you need more information about how to get the Embedded code from your Docsie check out my blog about publishing your documentation with your embedded code[ here.](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/publishing-product-documentation-with-docsie/)\n\nNow, within Visual Studio Code create a file (unless you have a file ready) for index.html, index.css. and index.js. Once that is done open your HTML and paste your code within the body of your html (under the </head> tag).\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ss2981O27UrVWVfrx/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/64bda798-9915-3b7b-274f-dc707b9118a2Snag_111c041e.png)\n\n## STEP 5\n\nNow for step 5 we need to create a 'Basic style'.\n\nYou can find more information about how to apply basic styling to your Docsie portals via our link here [https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/docsie-styling-guide/base-style/](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/docsie-styling-guide/base-style/)\n\nFor my example I added this to my HTML. and as you can see I added a company name link and I did some mild CSS to alter them.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_xg25e1fVbKEZbjJYl/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/a49b8d34-7911-10aa-741a-781224f57212Snag_1122dccd.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_fRoPLO0Df6JhTcf2h/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/7c668c24-8d5e-8fdf-5b2a-ad93de3b313cSnag_11238581.png)\n\nMy results look very basic, but I wanted you to see the potential that your tech team can do to spice up Docsie knowledge portals and create portals that match your brands look and feel. Keep in mind that you may have a different style, and colors; in fact in most cases our users put their logo which is embedded with their website links, they add navigations bars on top so that their Docsie knowledge portal fit seamlessly and naturally onto their company websites and match the environment and CSS of their current sites.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_StvlIomWiDjQ8wV0h/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/e02de6be-1990-cbe1-7078-4e477ec4a6d9Snag_112473e8.png)\n\n## STEP 6\n\nThen the last step I did was add some styling changes via this text here:\n\n```\n  <style>\n    :root {\n        --docsie-font-family: garamond;\n        --docsie-font-family-head: inherit;\n        --docsie-font-family-mono: monospace;\n        --docsie-hue-primary: 200;\n        --docsie-hue-gray: var(--docsie-hue-primary);\n        --docsie-sat-primary: 100%;\n     \n        --docsie-page-width: 1800px;   \n        --docsie-notice-background: var(--docsie-color-primary-darker);\n    }\n    </style>\n\n```\nI pasted it below the last div tag of the \u2018basic style\u2019.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ORs7jTN5WvXJ7VkuB/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/4cc0127b-2bca-4d38-3040-864b8f5054fdSnag_112741dd.png)\n\nAnd the results for my very basic style changes were this:\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_uCSLHwdeVry8finx8/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/82ffd090-9575-e89b-b0ed-16f4af08a405Snag_1127954c.png)\n\nNow that you have all the tools at your disposal, give it a try yourself, and see how it feels to change things around and create beautiful knowledge portals that you can be proud of! I am 100% certain that your knowledge portals will look way fancier then mine! :) So give it a try and most importantly have fun with it!\n\n\n\n", "header_image": "https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_TOZzF8nPZfo7bPj31/boo_EO7v3CdNAEEno7FUQ/97116078-5acb-b037-4b58-8bb4522d0942christopher_gower_m_HRfLhgABo_unsplash.jpg", "summary": "How to customize your Docsie portal by injecting your embedded Docsie code into Visual Studio Code.\n\n", "publish_date": "July 05, 2021", "categories": ["Product Documentation", "Documentation Portals", "Product Documentation Tutorials", "Knowledge Portal Design"], "status": 1, "path": "/blog/articles/how-to-customize-your-docsie-portal-by-injecting-your-embedded-docsie-code-into-visual-studio-code", "slug": "how-to-customize-your-docsie-portal-by-injecting-your-embedded-docsie-code-into-visual-studio-code", "previous": {"link": "../create-product-documentation-now-for-a-customer-centric-competitive-advantage", "title": "Create Product Documentation Now for a Customer-Centric Competitive Advantage"}, "next": {"link": "../7-golden-rules-to-successfully-approach-customer-feedback", "title": "7 Golden Rules To Successfully Approach Customer Feedback"}}, {"title": "Create Product Documentation Now for a Customer-Centric Competitive Advantage", "author_name": "Ciaran Sweet", "author_email": "content@soseo.co", "author_info": "A freelance technology writer that covers everything B2B and B2C!", "author_image": "https://cdn.docsie.io/user_profiles/8627/logo_logo_3KANTfZMqHKSow4aOi8st9Rei1fu6Cg66XKlyoiAIKtLa.png", "author_social": "", "markdown": "As a first port of call, any business selling products should ask how they can create product documentation. Documentation itself is a priceless tool, enabling businesses to share targeted knowledge with their customer base. When a business excels at knowledge sharing via digital documentation, it drives a significant customer-centric competitive advantage.\n\nConsider any existing marketing or sales materials your business uses. These materials are non-authoritative and purpose-built to promote your products, and your customers know this. Contrarily, product documentation acts as a showcase for your product and its underlying features. It warms up cold leads in the sales funnel and facilitates cross- or up-selling of your extended product portfolio. Simply put, product documentation gives your brand authority, instilling trust in prospective and persistent customers alike.\n\nThis is proven by an IEEE study which highlights how product documentation satisfaction directly correlates with perceived product quality. The better the documentation, the more convinced your customers will be of product quality!\n\nDo you have product documentation already? Either way, let us explore how to showcase the awesomeness that is your product using product documentation!\n\n## Product Documentation Formats\n\nDepending on the complexity of your product, it may be worthwhile using a specific product documentation format:\n\n\n\n### 1. **All-In-One Product Documentation**\n\nAll-in-one product documentation is suited to companies that sell products with low complexity. Much like the Yellow Pages (used to) have every local phone number, all of the information for your product is contained within a single document.\nIf you have no product documentation, an all-in-one user guide will merely suffice short-term. As your product grows in scale and complexity, this format will likely become unsustainable. This is a prime example of putting all your product eggs in one documentation basket; what happens when the basket is full or breaks?\n\n\n\n### 2. **Self-Service Knowledge Portals**\n\nAnyone who works in customer service will know that self-service knowledge portals offer immense value to the business. Customers agree, with 89% of surveyed customers in the US expecting a knowledge portal to be available. In laypersons terms, this means customers want access to structured digital product documentation with search functionality. Without it, your customer service team will be inundated with simple low-level product questions.\n\nWhen using this format, product documentation writers should structure content for readability. Short, concise answers beat long-winded explanations, and frequently asked questions (FAQs) should be front and center on the knowledge portal homepage.\n\n\n\n### 3. **Contextual Product Documentation**\n\nTo maximize customer satisfaction, industry leaders go one step further than a knowledge portal. Contextual product documentation involves integrating knowledge directly within your product. When a user loads the settings menu for the first time, contextual documentation could provide a step-by-step walkthrough detailing each function. Alternatively, a knowledge portal could be embedded in the sidebar of your page, enabling knowledge searching without any extra clicks.\n\nContextual product documentation does take time to develop, but the benefits far outweigh the costs. This Forrester study shows how 73% of respondents think valuing customer time is critical for good customer service. Contextual help does value customer time. It eliminates clicks and provides immediate knowledge; helping customers start doing more in less time.\n\n\n\n## Build Your Customer-Centric Competitive Advantage in Docsie\n\nWhether you have existing documentation, or no documentation at all, Docsie is a great place to get started! Docsie offers customer-centric collaboration, extensive embedding, tailored translations, and powerful publishing \u2013 all at your fingertips.\n\n### Understand Customers by Facilitating Feedback \n\nUnderstanding breeds empathy, and understanding your customer base breeds awareness of their needs. To understand, you need data.\n\nDocsie enables customers to write feedback on documentation, and collects this data via Docsie Vocally. Here you will find comments on your docs, a rating from the reader, and a video recording showing exactly what the reader was looking at.\n\nData leads to insight, and insights guide action. Use Docsie Vocally to elucidate customer feedback and maximize the value of your documentation.\n\n[Vocally by Docsie](https://help.docsie.io/jsfiddle.net?doc=/using-docsie/quick-start/#header-three-dcdes)\n\n![Docsie Vocally Feedback Form](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/hfqdsijgxnujiyvnbfdo \"Docsie Vocally Feedback Form\")\n\n### Structuring Your Knowledge Portal\n\nA knowledge portal is only useful when it\u2019s structured for easy navigation. Docsie provides structure using Books, Shelves, Workspaces, and content blocks.\n\nAs an example, a \u2018Getting Started\u2019 Book could sit on the \u2018First Time Setup\u2019 Shelf. This is contained within the \u2018My Product Name\u2019 Workspace. You could have another \u2018Administration\u2019 Shelf in the same Workspace, with a Book named \u2018User Management\u2019. By structuring your documentation using these Docsie features, readers can easily scan through and search for relevant information. Add as many Books and Shelves as you need; the sky is the limit!\n\nFinally, why publish text-only documentation when you can enrich it with Docsie content blocks? Move your customers with moving, interactive elements on the page! Along with standard text editor formatting like headers, lists, and bullet points, Docsie Editor allows for extended tooltips, image or video integration, and iFrame script embedding.\n\n![Docsie Editor Toolbar](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/xiwdhdxekaikfcgveihi \"Docsie Editor Toolbar\")\n\n![Docsie Shelves and Books in a Workspace](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/fsatbpedsecqafstgwch \"Docsie Shelves and Books in a Workspace\")\n\n[What is Docsie Editor](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/docsie-editor/adding-media/#section-header-two-ee89i)\n\n### Centralize Your Docs and Perfect the Art of Publishing\n\nWith large quantities of documentation, decentralization can lead to disaster. By centralizing your documentation, employees can craft and edit content with ease. More importantly, this also helps with publishing.\n\nDocsie centralizes documentation for ease of access using Workspaces. An entire Workspace, or individual Shelves and Books in said Workspace, can be published with two clicks. These documents are stored and hosted using Docsie servers, offering high availability and reliability for peace of mind. When your writers make changes, they will automatically propagate to your live Docsie knowledge portal. Advanced users can optionally self-host, enabling greater branding customization and more technical page element integrations.\n\n![A live view of a Docsie Portal](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/ztrwbdcjznqcqkgofnhz \"A live view of a Docsie Portal\")\n\nAs part of publishing, versioning allows for \u2018evergreen\u2019 documentation that changes as your product changes. When you update your product from version 1 to version 2, your docs will follow illustrating any changes. Customers can learn about new features thanks to this, and even refer back to older documentation if they use or need an older release of your product.\n\n![Publish Books and Shelves context menu in Docsie](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/fgzcadbebafclhvtrhvf \"Publish Books and Shelves context menu in Docsie\")\n\n![Version picker on a live Docsie Portal](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/vuddxclgluvcgtupojou \"Version picker on a live Docsie Portal\")\n\n### Contextual Documentation Enriches the Customer Experience\n\nHave you ever used a product, only to open a new tab and search for how to use that product? That product lacks contextual documentation, and it made you do extra work to figure it all out\u2026 not good!\n\nDocsie users can leverage [TourGuide.js](https://github.com/LikaloLLC/tourguide.js/) to offer guided tours to customers, all without leaving the main product dashboard. The result is akin to an integrated knowledge portal, overlaying within your product and sharing contextual advice to get users up to speed faster.\n\n![TourGuide.js example walkthrough](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/ebcdkxsfhzumealctwgl \"TourGuide.js example walkthrough\")", "header_image": "https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_c6ijrdjHdF0Wgu4dL/file_sCG9OjKfixrodlZEb/boo_0oVge5N4czYKASj6D/44669952-203b-90a2-6101-57154032a18eigor_miske_Px3iBXV_4TU_unsplash_(1).jpg", "summary": "Build your customer-centric competitive advantage with great product documentation", "publish_date": "July 02, 2021", "categories": ["Product Documentation", "Product Management", "Documentation Portals", "Product Updates", "Best Practices", "Product Documentation Tutorials"], "status": 1, "path": "/blog/articles/create-product-documentation-now-for-a-customer-centric-competitive-advantage", "slug": "create-product-documentation-now-for-a-customer-centric-competitive-advantage", "previous": {"link": "../confused-about-product-and-software-documentation-don-t-worry-they-re-one-in-the-same", "title": "Confused About Product and Software Documentation?

How can the average user be productive with this product? In this sense, product documentation could be used for software products.\n\nSoftware documentation refers to the underlying technologies, prerequisites, and configurable attributes of a software product. How do IT administrators configure, monitor, host, and deploy the software product for users? This type of documentation is important, especially when multiple versions or branches are added into the mix.\n\nIn a sense, product documentation is like teaching someone how to drive a car. The wheel turns the car, the accelerator pedal moves the car, the brake pedal stops the car. Software documentation teaches someone how the car works. The wheel is connected to the front axle which turns the front tires to alter the course of travel; the accelerator increases airflow to the engine which draws in more fuel, generating torque and horsepower.\n\nBoth documentation types are important. One educates users, and one educates administrators and developers. It\u2019s great showing people how to drive a car, but if nobody knows how the car works, what happens when the car breaks down?\n\n## Minor Differences Between Product and Software Documentation\n\nThere are minor differences to be aware of with product and software documentation:\n\n### Software and Product Documentation: Target Audience and Persona\n\nProduct documentation caters to a single audience; the user. It assumes the user has no technical knowledge, communicating in plain English with minimal jargon. Much like a technical apprenticeship versus a university degree, it educates people on how to do things, with less focus on theoretical or conceptual knowledge.\n\nSoftware documentation is targeted to IT administrators, engineers, and developers. It covers the design and architecture of software, command line setup instructions, API and integration support, data management and reporting, network topology \u2013 basically the cogs that make the machine work. These documents form a single-source-of-truth (SSOT) that IT personnel can refer to when monitoring and troubleshooting the software application.\n\n### Software and Product Documentation: Update Frequencies\n\nSoftware documentation must be consistently updated as new commits are merged into the main release channel. The software documentation must highlight new functions and commands, and deprecate old features. New or changing dependencies should be documented, and feature support across all target platforms should be clarified \u2013 such as one feature working on Windows, but not Linux.\n\nProduct documentation only needs updating when underlying software edits trigger a change in workflow or usability. A developer changes the code for a payment gateway, but the payment process for users stays the same, so no updates are needed.\n\nThis shows a natural hierarchy for software product documentation. Technical software documentation forms the foundation, and subsequent product documentation is based on this foundation. Therefore, the focus should be on making great software documentation, as it breeds even greater product documentation.\n\n\n\n## Example Formatting Frameworks for Product and Software Documentation\n\nA piece of product documentation could follow this framework:\n\n* *Product Name*\n\n* *Overview of Product Purpose*\n\n* *Setup Guide*\n\n* *Feature 1 Explanation and Images*\n\n* *Feature 2 Explanation and Images*\n\n* *Customer Support Links*\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a piece of software documentation could follow this framework:\n\n* *Software Name*\n\n* *Overview of Software Purpose*\n\n* *Software Dependencies*\n\n* *Installation Guide*\n\n* *Function 1 Explanation and Images*\n\n* *Function 2 Explanation and Images*\n\n* *Technical Support Links*\n\n\n\nClearly, these two documentation types are closely related to each other and follow a similar structure. This means that product and software teams have a lot to learn from one another, and a lot of potential when working collaboratively on documentation.\n\n## Product and Software Documentation Teams Can Complement Each Other\n\nThere are stark similarities between product and software documentation. This presents the question: can product and software teams work together?\n\nYes, they can, and they should!\n\nSoftware teams understand the technical jargon and underlying technologies. Product teams understand what users see, want, and need; the user experience. Software documentation writers can provide detailed technical information, and product documentation writers can dilute the technical details for consumption by a layperson audience.\n\nImagine trying to explain something in laypersons terms, without having the high-level understanding needed to formulate something a layperson would understand. That is what happens when product documentation is created before software documentation.\n\nWhat is quantum mechanics? Schrodinger\u2019s cat is probably the first thought in your head! But what does quantum mechanics have to do with cats? To the user, it\u2019s not important. To a physicist, it means everything.\n\n## Start With Software Documentation, End With Better Product Documentation in Docsie\n\nTo conclude, there are many benefits when using software documentation as a template for subsequent product documentation. Software documentation should act as a single-source-of-truth for IT personnel and product documentation writers. After it is written, product documentation writers will have the clarity and understanding to simplify and share user-friendly knowledge with customers, with technical guidance for proofreading and quality assurance.\n\nSimply, by starting with great software documentation, your writers can craft even better product documentation!\n\nStart crafting documentation that helps your customers do more.

Also I showed you how to embed videos, pictures, media as well as code so that you can create product documentation so that you can further educate your customers about your technical platforms and solutions.\n\nNow I wanted to take a deep dive in Docsie product documentation platform and show you how to create software documentation simple and easily.\n\nHere is a quick tutorial on how to explain how to publish with Docsie.\n\nPublishing with Docsie\u2019s knowledge portal can be done in a few ways. In this video I explain how to publish with Docsie\u2019s knowledge portals, books, shelves or articles with one simple line of code.\n\nIn this example I wanted to publish this specific book called 'Writing your first Django app, part 2'\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_vghRPvDGV9FcXW5sq/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/8baf35b2-88ce-eb21-1eca-e13454c076beimage.png)\n\n\n\nAs you can see in my current already created software documentation I have written a version called 'Brand new portal that I am working on\" and if you click on the 'pencil' tool near it you have the option of making your published portal 'active' or 'primary' or turning these features off. which is awesome because that means you and your team can write your or update your documentation and not have it visible to your customers or clients until you are ready to have it published your created product documentation in production on your website:\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Wpue5g2itHdkeHQWH/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/e1957632-a49c-efea-8206-7ea31886a8dcimage.png)\n\nThat that I you are ready to publish its time to deploy your documentation!  This is done easily by first clicking on the three dots at the top right corner of the Docsie platform, and then clicking on your account:\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Vyh10Vht9p5HgACri/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/cc784b29-8edd-ade4-807c-cb6a30b61998image.png)\n\nOnce you are on your Profile and settings page,  click the tab entitled \"Deployments'. this will bring you to the deployment page and help you get set up on creating your embedder code that will be placed upon your website.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_FOdT3hJo8ygjq6lYH/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/ed142930-2a7b-b56c-0ccf-3183c6191179image.png)\n\nNow click \"Configure a new deployment +\" \n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_vbyck51UPHrWOVomu/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/c3affc72-9cdd-b8ee-4c51-5798f54e5688image.png)\n\n\n\nGreat! Now that you have access to the dashboard all you need to do is deploy a custom domain this is done easy by opening the \"Deploy a domain: tab bar and clicking 'custom deployment'\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Xlx7uCVpKiy3TJbaI/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/30f5281a-702a-9bd4-a926-9440f1aaef22image.png)\n\nNow the next two steps are simple: \n\n1. The first step is to type in your domain (and remember to use http:// or https:// before writing your domain name)\n\n2. the second step is to pick what you want to publish, you have the choice to publish, a Book or an entire Shelf. In this example I am publishing a book entailed: 'Writing your first Django app, part 2'\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Tac6kZ9pjFovGo8Ut/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/2d5ad6d7-27fc-c487-f6bc-b97d7f1be44aimage.png)\n\nGreat! Now the last step is before getting our code is to click \"+More Options\"\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_OrYP2ugvhlurWxfbJ/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/390a98c1-f554-9ae3-7e09-8faed42d93a2image.png)\n\n\n\nNow you can use our various plugins, features and other documentation options to spice up your knowledge portal and make it more handy for your users. These features,  plugins and  product documentation tools are quite nifty and make your knowledge portals more robust.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Wy76iK9zPT84NoPdu/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/ed41417e-41dc-cffc-161a-4ffa182d3796image.png)\n\nnote: you can change these additional features and plugins and other product documentation tools any time. \n\nOnce that's done click 'Create web portal'.\n\nNow scroll down to the bottom and click \"+ Get deployment script\"\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Lv7JtNkP26EPzxBTw/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/6196219b-ddb3-55b8-d15f-3b08276ebbc2image.png)\n\nAnd copy your script and paste it into your HTML:\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_C7q3zLB0gXrf4HObS/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/550abafc-23f2-e1f3-138a-7435eca30e4fimage.png)\n\nNow that you have access to your script you can spice things up with our CSS user guide, it will help you create a stylish Docsie knowledge portal that matches your brands looks and feel.

If that's the case, keep reading.\n\nIt can be difficult to share and educate others. Especially if you don't have a good example for a training manual template to get you started quickly. In this article, I'll show you how to increase productivity and decrease downtime by using Docsie to create a simple training manual template and sharing it with your team.\n\n## Step 1: Create an account with Docsie (it's free). \n\n## \n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_wX9JoNbS1HNZqB1vU/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/964e0589-ee96-b0fb-6fdd-d760b5e81f53image.png)\n\nDocsie is a simple training manual development tool that provides companies with reusable templates to help them develop better training manuals. To get started, it's completely free, and you can build your first training manual in under 10 minutes. Once you are signed up we can begin to explain how to write a training manual through Docsie.\n\n\n\n## Step 2: Create a book to make an awesome basic training manual template.\n\nDocsie is based on the concept of books and shelves, with books serving essentially as instructional manuals and shelves serving as departments and knowledge base hubs.\n\nAssume you're a busy sales team with a need to have all of your outbound training materials in one place. You may use Docsie to organize and categorize your training manuals using sets. You can then invite the rest of the training team to collaborate and build better training manuals together once you're ready.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_qd5uDhTnzIv7i7usI/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/eeee9ae3-949a-4a68-ff86-1774bdad3340image.png)\n\n## Step 3 - Define training instructions\n\nThis is where you'll identify the training categories and pathways you'll need to create to order to educate your target audience.\n\nKeep in mind that this guide assumes that you already know who your target audience is; this guide's aim is to show you how to easily build content for your instructional training manual.\n\nConsider a sales force. It has beginner and advanced sales tracks for a variety of positions, including SDRs (Sales Growth Representatives), Account Executives, Customer Success Representatives, and so on. The positions can have different names and responsibilities depending on the nature of your sales company, but they all require training manuals and a traceable way to share information.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_G26esoODDFXA7gBlw/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/0bbdb8bd-8fa4-5057-8bb2-4816e06b647aimage.png)\n\nAs a result, once you've identified your training tracks, you can start interviewing experts in those positions to help you determine the content for those tracks. As an example, you could interview an account executive to learn more about how they work.\n\nOnce you know their everyday routine, practices and duties you'll construct a process diagram that details the tasks of that specific job, giving you a clear picture of those responsibilities.\n\nYou'll then break down those duties into actionable steps by stage/seniority, which will make creating a training manual a breeze because you will know what and how to write a manual for your specific team.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_h2VzPUoPrfLAgyWSZ/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/426f2d7b-d360-d8d2-3042-01b6797217c2image.png)\n\nOnce you have completed gathering enough information, you can use it to develop your training material using a training manual template.\n\n\n\n## Step 4: Develop training materials\n\nFollowing the outline and road map you drew up for yourself in the previous steps, and armed with the information gathered from your team. You will begin to fill your training and instruction manual template prototype with content, stage by stage, gradually expanding each stage to help your trainees develop a proper training base.\n\n\nDifferent articles can devise different steps in Docsie to illustrates in training manuals. There are many great tools that work together with Docsie to help you easily build amazing manuals.\n\n\n\n## Amazing tools\n\nThere are many amazing tools you can use to help you gain the cutting edge over the creation of your training manuals and help you on the path to developing and filling in your instruction manual template.\n\n## Snag-It\n\n> Note: If you're a Mac user, in order to copy and paste the image into Docsie using Shift, Command, and 4.\n\nSnag-it allows you to easily take a photo of your page's content and annotate it with a sleek and simple annotation tool.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_WB2ORmffxUjyz00Yq/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/95d5c0e9-15c6-6429-45c5-88ab34c2d9a6image.png)\n\n## Camtasia\n\nCamtasia will help you easily record how-to videos to improve the training experience and improve the effectiveness of your training manuals.\n\n\n\n## Docsie Guides\n\n\n\nUsing a simple chrome extension, you can use Docsie Guides to automatically record your training manuals as well as all of your training images with annotations. Docsie Guides will also assist you in creating non-coded guided tours to demonstrate how to use your product to consumers or new trainees.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_8ae41KnpRQi0C0u7t/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/9fbb3165-564b-a2c7-66db-1076080930a04ddd50e0_12bf_9027_3986_78792c015969Gifs_optimized.gif)\n\n## Step 5 - Publish your training manual and share it with your team\n\nYou must want to share your training material with your new trainees and/or customers now that you've developed it in Docsie. It's as easy as clicking publish and having it appear on a Docsie embedded page on your site.\n\nIf you want to limit access to all of your training material, you can do so easily in Docsie. You can also allocate a unique password to a particular trainee and revoke access at any time.\n\nWith only one line of code, you can also insert your training material directly into your company's intranet using Docsie.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_SReYm8UdA6cJ9A6PX/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/0323cf4c-d72e-5b5c-5e0f-fcf03d027ce4image.png)\n\n\n\n## Step 6: Collect feedback on your training manual and update it on Docsie.\n\nOnce you've released your training manual prototype, you're ready to go. You may want to learn how your trainees and/or customers communicate with your training manual and give them the chance to provide you with actionable feedback so you can better your job.\n\nThis is where you can use Vocally (a Docsie Extension) to collect video clips of your trainees' training experiences to better understand how they deal with your instruction manual template. You may also give them the option of providing input on their training experience, which will be categorized in Vocally manager.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_OqJHxdveDITl5by25/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/0a5ecb60-0b4b-1bf9-f1c6-d9a0a1357ca5image.png)\n\nYou can then use Vocally Manager, which is easily incorporated with your project monitoring software, to build actionable tasks for yourself to update and refine how you write a manual based on user feedback.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_TCiT6UQygjeRreFqY/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/b0696bf6-153e-b42a-4933-97fd097dd59eimage.png)\n\n## Step 7: Maintain and translate the material of your training manual.\n\nYou can now translate your instructional manual templates into multiple languages right on Docsie, and you can even communicate with experienced content translators who can help you update your content at a discounted rate.\n\nFurthermore, creating new versions of your training materials in Docsie is as easy as clicking a button as your training materials grow. As a result, you will not lose any more valuable training copies and will still have a point of reference to refer to.\n\n\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543386650-2be9a18d2750?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGZpbmFsJTIwdGhvdWdodHN8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjIwMTU3MTg3&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nDocsie can be used if you are serious about making excellent training manuals and use instructional manual templates. It will significantly simplify and improve the workflow of your training manual.\n\nInstructional manual templates play an important role in employee training by informing new employees about the organization and its procedures. Employees are maturing and learning new technologies, techniques, and processes.\n\nEmployees who aren't actively learning or who aren't knowledgeable about the devices, applications, equipment, or machinery used by their company may become disengaged at work.\n\nHowever, disengagement often leads to high employee turnover and poor work satisfaction. In the end, both the employers and employees suffer losses.\n\n\n\nNot to mention, there are statistics to back this up:\n\n\n\nWithin a year, 40% of workers with inadequate training quit their jobs.\n\nBecause of a lack of growth opportunities, 74 percent of workers feel they are not reaching their full potential at work.\n\nEmployees consider contributing financially to training in 72 percent of cases.\n\n\n\nAccording to 68 percent of employees, the company's most important agenda is growth and training.\n\nJust 13% of workers worldwide are engaged.\n\n\n\nEmployee disengagement costs the economy more than $500 billion each year.\n\nThe numbers, on the other hand, are endless. The problem is real. Employees want to grow and improve their skills in both traditional training and developmental opportunities.\n\n\n\nA great way for businesses to get started on this much-needed method is to create a fantastic company training guide or training manual.\n\n\n\nWe need to get down to the point and figure out what the most important aspects of a fantastic training manual would be and how to write a manual.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, 45 percent of learning hours in a typical company were created by online or even e-learning methods, according to the ATD (Association-for-Talent-Development-in-the-United-States). In comparison to 2015, this represents a 42 percent increase.\n\n\n\nThe ability to develop an instruction manual template is a natural skill that is necessary for business continuity and growth.\n\n\n\n", "header_image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587440871875-191322ee64b0?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1051&q=80", "summary": "How leading organizations gain a competitive advantage by keeping their training manuals plain, succinct, and highly successful.", "publish_date": "May 04, 2021", "categories": ["Product Documentation", "Product Management", "Documentation Portals", "Best Practices", "Product Documentation Tutorials"], "status": 1, "path": "/blog/articles/the-ultimate-training-manual-template-guide-in-2021", "slug": "the-ultimate-training-manual-template-guide-in-2021", "previous": {"link": "../create-a-knowledge-base-that-does-actual-work-for-your-enterprise-and-customers", "title": "Create a Knowledge Base that Does Actual Work for Your Enterprise and Customers"}, "next": {"link": "../publishing-product-documentation-with-docsie", "title": "Publishing Product Documentation With Docsie"}}, {"title": "Create a Knowledge Base that Does Actual Work for Your Enterprise and Customers", "author_name": "Tal F.", "author_email": "tal@docsie.io", "author_info": "VP of Customer Success @ Docsie", "author_image": " https://cdn.docsie.io/user_profiles/15/logo_logo_QmXrbijvL0L2hFKNm6Q25DtjahujKdB6nu4pqBlLBgvtT.png", "author_social": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tal-frenkel-1363b2209/", "markdown": "![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/fgdkkvoukhpdltavfjsp)\n\nImagine if you can take all of the valuable information that\u2019s scattered across your enterprise in emails, physical folders, shared drives and more, and put it into one easily, accessible location. And then, allow your employees and customers to leverage all of that information to their benefit.\n\nAt its most basic level, a knowledge base is a digital library of carefully curated information that can be stored, organized, searched, modified and shared. When viewed in the context of enterprise infrastructure, it\u2019s the epicenter of all of your enterprise\u2019s knowledge and one of the most frequent ways your stakeholders will experience or interact with your enterprise.\n\nThere is no question that in today\u2019s world, enterprises that want to function efficiently need a knowledge base. You just need to know what type of knowledge base you need and how to create it.\n\n\n\n### What Type of Knowledge Base Does Your Enterprise Need?\n\n**Employee Knowledge Base**\n\nAn internal knowledge base consolidates enterprise knowledge and the collective know-how of employees. It is a must-have if you want your employees to have access to the information that can help them do their jobs as seamlessly as possible. You can include any sort of information that has to be shared within your enterprise, such as:\n\n* Employee handbook\n\n* Product catalog\n\n* Best practices\n\n* HR policies\n\n* Onboarding training for new employees\n\nThe knowledge base should also promote collaboration between your employees, giving them the capability to pose questions and provide answers to one another. \u00a0\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/smkjimvctbbblpexslsg)\n\nWhy is this so important? There is no enterprise that doesn\u2019t benefit from its employees being more productive and more engaged.\n\n\n\n**Customer Knowledge Base**\n\nYou have to let your customers help themselves. Why? Because they want to. According to Gartner, [70% of customers](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/rethink-customer-service-strategy-drive-self-service/) use a self-service channel at some time in their journey to a resolution.\u00a0\n\nAny content that can help customers understand and use your service or product should be included. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* How-to articles\n\n* FAQ sections\n\n* Glossaries\n\n* Case studies\n\n* Video tutorials\n\n* White papers\u00a0\n\nAn external or customer-facing knowledge base will not solve *every* issue your customers may have with your service or product, just the most common ones. So, whenever you begin to get the same question repeatedly from customers, save your customers and employees a lot of time and just put the answer in the knowledge base.\u00a0\n\n**Why Not Both?**\n\nYou may find that your enterprise will benefit most from a knowledge base that is a combination of the two. Of course, you wouldn\u2019t want all of the information on the knowledge base to be accessible to all users.\u00a0\n\nFor example, do your customers really need to know about how your enterprise\u2019s HR policies for addressing tardy workers? Even within the information posted for just employees, it may be necessary to limit some employees\u2019 access to certain parts of the knowledge base due to their job title or the department they work in. If you are working with the [right documentation platform](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/), this will be no problem because you\u2019ll be able to manage access to certain information by applying user [permissions](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/workspace-administration/managing-and-understanding-permissions/).\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Factors to Consider When Creating Your Knowledge Base\n\nCreating the knowledge base your enterprise needs isn\u2019t just something you can throw together, post online and expect to function as it should. It takes a bit of reflection, planning and *the right tools* to get it right. Take a look at some of the factors you should consider when developing a knowledge base.**\u00a0**\n\n**Enterprise Issues That Would Be Solved By a Knowledge Base.** Do your customers seem to ask the very same questions repeatedly, affecting employee productivity and customer satisfaction goals? Do your employees find it difficult to do their job because they have to search multiple places to locate the information they need?\n\n**The Core Content Elements of Your Knowledge Base.\u00a0**You should conduct a full content audit to determine exactly what type of content is floating around your enterprise, if the information is still accurate and what information is missing. And remember, the content will not make the impact you want if it's not in its best form, no matter how valuable the content is. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/zrqneyzfqyphryogrgrz)\n\n**Organization and Structure of Topics and Articles.\u00a0**A knowledge base should be structured in a logical way and be consistent so that it is easy to navigate. Look to your brand so that the information your post into the knowledge base has the [same tone and visuals](https://www.docsie.io/documentation/styling_guide/).\u00a0\n\n**Metrics to Determine the Success of Your Knowledge Base.\u00a0**How else can you be sure that your knowledge base is doing what it is supposed to do? The metrics that you will use can vary, depending on the purpose of the knowledge base, but here are some examples want you may want to monitor:\n\n* Search activity, including search keywords\n\n* Content performance based on type, ratings, visits and page views\n\n* [Real-time actions of customers](https://www.docsie.io/gather_feedback/) on the knowledge base**\u00a0**\n\n**The Right Software to Create and Manage Your Knowledge Base.\u00a0**The documentation platform you use to develop your knowledge base should be able to scale along with your enterprise. It should have the functionalities to incorporate the features you want in your knowledge base. Let's take a brief look at [Docsie](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/).\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/jogqsbhmvygmrsltjagl)\n\n### Using Docsie to Create and Customize Your Knowledge Base\n\nDocsie is a dynamic documentation platform that unifies documentation creation, content management, and content integration into one seamless platform, making it easy for you to create and maintain a knowledge base. Look at how easy it can be:\u00a0\n\n* We mentioned earlier that collaboration should be a key function of an internal knowledge base. Docsie, provides a [built-in chat function](https://www.docsie.io/markdown_editor/) in its editor to encourage and improve collaboration between teams.\n\n* If your target audience is global, you can have your knowledge base content [translated automatically](https://www.docsie.io/self-writing-documentation/).\n\n* This is how easy it is to [publish](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/publish-documentation-portal/): simply use one line of code to publish your knowledge base documentation to your enterprise website or app. That\u2019s it. Really.\n\n* Remember how we said that you should be able to analyze how your users interact with the knowledge base? With Docsie, you can also receive insights based on predictive documentation AI to enhance your documents to improve those interactions.\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/evgertppxkcxediwezzy)\n\nIf you create an optimal knowledge base, your employees and customers will know that you have valuable information and that you believe that their access to that information is a priority. The knowledge base will serve as one of the faces of your enterprise, so it is worthwhile taking the effort and using the right software to ensure that it works.\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "header_image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508558936510-0af1e3cccbab?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1050&q=80", "summary": "Imagine if you can take all of the valuable information that\u2019s scattered across your enterprise in emails, physical folders, shared drives and more, and put it into one easily, accessible location.

Contracts, policies, meeting notes; everything was paper-based - being printed and passed around instead of attached and analyzed via email.\n\nAs technology became more advanced, businesses had more storage space for documentation, and the computer systems needed for employees to access these digital documents. This marks the start of a transition away from paper to pixels.\n\nThe modern world of digital documentation offers numerous benefits, but problems persist. Documentation is used to convey information, both to internal staff and external customers. This means that consistency of content, ease of access, and ease of management are essential. Contrarily, inconsistent, inaccessible and unmanageable digital documentation can reduce your businesses ability to effectively convey information.\n\nTo drive ease and consistency, enterprises should follow digital documentation best-practices. This encompasses the design, formatting, choice of file types, and governance of digital documentation.\n\nIn this eBook, we will discuss best-practices for digital documentation and the potential business impact of making these changes. Can better digital documentation drive revenue growth and attract customers? How can businesses transform their digital documentation to deliver better value to customers using a documentation management system, or DMS?\n\nLet us answer these questions!\n\nDigital Documentation Benefits\n==============================\n\nBefore we discuss the what and how of digital documentation best-practices, first we should understand the benefits of digital documentation:\n\n- **Ease of Management** -- Digital documentation is easier to manage than paper documents. Paper documentation requires space in the office for a filing cabinet, and requires manual archiving for each paper document. Digital document storage frees up office real estate, and simplifies management with search functionality and folder structures.\n\nAs detailed in this Software Advice study, office workers spend an average of six hours per week searching for paper documents. Additionally, office workers spend an average of eight hours per week creating reports from paper documents, with 94% saying that a document management system (DMS) makes this process easier.[[1]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn1)\n\n- **Ease of Access** - These digital documents can also be shared, virtually in real-time, via email or cloud storage. This negates the need for posting letters, eliminating postage or courier costs. It also increases the speed of response, as recipients no longer need to wait days for a letter to arrive. Furthermore, digital documentation can be deployed on your website or social media, improving ease of access for customers.\n\nDid you know that - according to Gartner - for every $1 spent on printing documents, another $6 is spent on handling and distributing these documents? Furthermore, half of all printed documents are thrown away within 24 hours.[[2]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn2)\n\n- **Security and Governance** -- Unless its hidden behind a lock and key, paper documentation is insecure. Anyone can read it, make a copy, and share as they see fit. Contrarily, digital documentation can be governed by role-based access controls (RBAC) to grant access only to those who need it.\n\nEven Governments are not immune to paper data breaches, with the US Department for Veterans Affairs attributing paper documentation as the reason for 98% of data breaches[[3]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn3).\n\n- **Environmental Benefits** -- People and businesses alike are searching for ways to reduce their environmental footprint. Digital documentation is one route they can take. According to Green America, paper consumption has risen by 400% in the last 40 years, with the industry accounting for 4% of global energy consumption[[4]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn4). By opting for digital documentation, businesses can reduce their paper usage to combat deforestation -- keeping trees alive to absorb carbon emissions and sustain animal habitats.\n\n**Best-Practices With Digital Documentation on Docsie**\n\nDigital documentation has the capacity to transform knowledge sharing, publishing, and marketing across the business. To tap into this potential, businesses should follow digital documentation best-practices:\n\nAlign Your DMS With Business Needs\n----------------------------------\n\nA document management system (DMS) is the foundation that helps businesses store and manage their documentation. After content is written, it is uploaded to a DMS for storage and distribution. A DMS centralizes documentation storage, providing a single source of knowledge for the entire business. This functions much like a digital library, categorizing documents by department or product, with search functionality to streamline knowledge sharing. From here, marketing and support teams can share documentation, publishing it on websites and social media, or in response to customer queries.\n\nDocsie is a DMS that simplifies the way your team does docs. Every business needs a way to store and share documentation, both so internal staff can learn about their job role, and customers can learn how to use your product or service. HR onboarding documents, product how-to guides, sales communication templates -- all of these items can be stored and published with the right DMS solution.\n\nWhat documentation currently exists on your products and services? Do your staff use templates and frameworks when communicating with customers? Can you easily store, internally share, and externally publish your documentation? Ask these questions when considering a DMS solution like Docsie, and ensure that your DMS is aligned with business needs.\n\nFocus on Compatibility\n----------------------\n\nDigital documentation can increase accessibility, but only when using highly-compatible file formats. This is important with downloadable documentation, as certain customers may be unable to open a file. It also applies to internal documentation, where one employee using PDF and another using DOCX may cause file format fragmentation -- prompting other employees to switch software packages, or convert to another format to make the file accessible.\n\nOpen file formats like docx, xlsx, and pptx for Microsoft Office, or the open document format (ODF) for OpenOffice are ideal for maximizing compatibility. Adobe PDF documents are common, but less compatible due to requiring a PDF viewer. Consider who will be accessing these documents, and store documentation in a format that caters to the widest possible user base.\n\nDocsie is a great option for broad document compatibility. When text is loaded into the Docsie Book Editor, it is stored in the open-source JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format. You can find more information on exporting documents, and how Docsie enables easy conversion into DOC, PDF, Markdown (MD) and HTML formats [here](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/docsie-editor/exporting-content/).\n\nActionable Feedback\n-------------------\n\nUser and employee feedback on documentation is vital. If documentation lacks information, contains incorrect information, or is simply hard to read -- readers will struggle to get any value from your documentation. Furthermore, feedback can help you improve existing documentation to provide more value to customers, driving business success through quality knowledge sharing.\n\nDocsie Vocally is an all-in-one feedback monitoring and response service. It allows readers to rank individual pieces of documentation on a scale of one to five, with comments to explain the reasons for their rating. Docsie Owners and Admins can read this feedback, gaining insight into the success and shortcomings of your documentation.\n\nSelf-service knowledge bases are designed to minimize support requirements, but this also means that customers are unlikely to persist with bad documentation -- instead searching for an alternative with competitors who provide better documentation. To tackle this problem, Docise Vocally will record user interactions as they read your documentation. This will highlight where they encountered a problem in a document, and what content is causing the problem. Writers can use this feedback to edit documentation and act on user feedback. Over time, this will improve the quality of documentation knowledge, empowering customers to help themselves.\n\nCustomer empowerment is a great way to attract new business, reduce costs, and retain customers. Around 67% of customers prefer self-service to speaking over the phone, according to Zendesk[[5]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn5). Forrester Research and Oracle also found that self-service can drive down support costs by $11 per call[[6]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn6). Finally, a study from Microsoft highlights how 90% of customers expect a self-service option[[7]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn7).\n\nSummarily, customers prefer and expect quality self-service, and providing this option can significantly reduce support costs. By creating a self-service knowledge base in Docsie, and improving documentation quality with feedback through Docsie Vocally - you can cater to evolving customer demands through digital documentation.

The new version may include different workflows to previous versions, or different terminology that may confuse users. Concurrently, new documentation may not apply to older versions of your services, creating knowledge gaps that have the potential to frustrate and drive away customers.\n\nThis is an important best-practice with digital documentation. Customers may need older versions of your software for compatibility with their hardware, or simply choose to not update to a new version. Thus, businesses should always cater to their user base regardless of the version number being used.\n\nDocsie tackles this problem with document versioning. When you update a document in Docsie, you can retain previous versions for redundancy purposes. Customers on version 2 of your service can select the right documentation, with customers on version 1 still having access to older documentation. This is called fragmentation; when your customer base is split across multiple versions of the same software. Docsie reduces the impact of fragmentation, ensuring knowledge is available no matter the version being used.\n\nDocument versioning ensures the right information is available when needed. It also helps with traceability, especially when multiple writers are working on the same piece of content. Versioning also reduces duplication, consolidating your documentation for ease of access.\n\nDoes your business regularly update its documentation? Are your customers struggling to find the right information for current and historic versions of your software and services? If so, it may be time to apply the best-practice of document versioning through a DMS like Docsie. You can find more information on Docise document versioning [here](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/docsie-editor/managing-versions/).\n\nWorkforce Documentation Habits\n------------------------------\n\nYour people create documentation, but they can also create problems with documentation. During the draft phase, writers may use different font sizes or types, or outdated iconography and artwork. These differences are easy to miss for employees that work with content every day, but customers are more likely to notice. The result is inconsistent documentation, driven by inconsistencies in the approach to content creation and publishing across your workforce.\n\nDocsie helps businesses tackle content inconsistency with the Docsie Documentation Hub. You can set a default font type and size, add company logos or artwork, and define CSS style sheet parameters for use on a company website or knowledge base. These choices will propagate from Docsie to any web page with Docsie embedded content, using the same colors, fonts and logos everywhere your content is published.\n\nThis simplifies content management and publishing workflows. Rather than editing individual pages, businesses can set a content design framework once in Docsie and apply those changes everywhere. This is known as centralized management or orchestration. The process of editing each document or page individually may seem doable for smaller content libraries, but this process will not scale efficiently as the library grows in breadth and depth.\n\nIn summary, Docsie works to futureproof your content management workflows by minimizing low-level administrative workloads. By starting with scale in mind, large content libraries can be managed with simplicity - setting content design frameworks once and deploying everywhere with Docsie. You can find out more about Docsie Customized Documentation Hubs using the Docsie Manager [here](https://www.docsie.io/docsie_manager/).\n\nCentralized Documentation Storage\n---------------------------------\n\nOn the topic of centralization, document storage locations can help or hinder management and publishing workflows. You may store documentation on an intranet or SharePoint site, in Dropbox or Google Drive, and on-premise or cloud storage partitions. Each option here works in isolation, but can cause chaos when used simultaneously.\n\nAn employee needs access to a document. The document is stored on a SharePoint site. The employee downloads it and saves it to their account storage partition. A business file synchronization tool uploads this to the cloud automatically. The employee sends the document via Slack to a colleague. That's four copies of the same document in circulation on your IT network, with decentralization across four different services or tools.\n\nDocsie tackles this decentralized chaos by centralizing documents in a single storage location. When you upload a document, Docsie places the document on a shelf. We refer to documents as books, with each shelf filling up with books to form a content library. Employees can log into Docsie to find all of your documentation, with filtering that delivers relevant documentation by department or seniority using role-based access controls (RBAC). From here, employees can publish documents directly to your website, edit documentation text, check different versions, and view feedback from customers or colleagues.\n\nNow, when an employee needs access to a document, all they have to do is open Docsie. They can search for documents, export in common file formats, and share direct links to Docsie books or shelves. For external users, they can be invited by Owners and Admins for direct access to authorized Docsie books and shelves, without compromising on security. It's like folders and files on a hard drive, but with a little Docsie magic! You can find out more about Docsie shelves and books [here](https://www.docsie.io/features/).\n\nDocument Governance Risk and Compliance\n---------------------------------------\n\nMost documentation will be created for the public domain. Still, some documentation may be confidential. This presents the need for governance risk and compliance (GRC) management. GRC policies can be used to govern access to confidential documents, control document permissions for writers and readers, and prevent accidental publication of documentation in the draft phase.\n\nDocsie uses role-based access controls (RBAC) to govern permissions on the platform. This is how Docsie helps businesses manage GRC workflows, by defining user roles and assigning permissions based on seniority or department. These roles include Viewer, Editor, Admin, and Owner. Viewers are granted read-only access to documents, with editors being granted read and write permissions. Admins can assign roles to manage who is allowed to read, write or both per book or per shelf. The Owner can manage every user and document in a Docsie organization, and is the only user role that can delete an entire organization. In this example, the organization could be Docsie, with shelves containing books on different functionalities in Docsie.\n\nIn conclusion, GRC is important for managing access to documentation. With too little access, employees will be unable to work on documentation. With too much access, employees may accidentally publish unfinished documentation, or gain access to confidential documents that are reserved for executives and managers. Docsie helps you strike a balance between access and security, making the platform suitable for storing any type of document.\n\nThis document is sensitive, how can I prevent unauthorized access? How can I give my team write permissions, while only giving other teams read-only access? A freelance writer needs permission to edit this document, how can I do that? If your business is asking these questions, Docsie has the answers! You can find more information on Docsie permissions management [here](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/workspace-administration/managing-and-understanding-permissions/).\n\nTeam Collaboration\n------------------\n\nContent is rarely crafted by a single person. When multiple writers are working on your documentation library, collaboration is critical.\n\nWhat processes do your employees follow when working on documentation? An example would be searching on a network drive for existing documents and downloading to a computer. Next, the writer may send a final draft via email to a colleague for further proofing. The approved draft may then be uploaded to a content management system (CMS) ready for publishing. Later in the day, someone notices a problem and sends an annotated version back to the writer via Slack. This workflow may work, but it can be simplified.\n\nDocsie reduces the number of tools you need with comprehensive team collaboration functionality. You can find documents in Docsie, write and edit, share changes with team members, chat and annotate, and publish to the internet without ever leaving the Docsie dashboard. This negates the need for downloading, uploading, emailing, and managing a CMS -- allowing you to simply manage your docs with Docsie! Team members can be tagged using @mention, chat conversations are isolated to each Docsie book, and external freelancers can be invited with ease for full team collaboration in any location.\n\nBy minimizing the number of tools required, employees can focus on creating content instead of switching between software. This expedites content creation workflows by minimizing wasted clicks, with comments and suggestions from colleagues being easily accessible in the right-hand toolbar. No more link sharing, no more outdated versions of documents, no more lost emails or chat messages -- everything to do with your docs is centralized in Docsie.\n\nApply Best-Practices to Your Docs With Docsie\n=============================================\n\nAs we move from paper to pixels, good documentation management is vital. By applying these best-practices to digital documentation, businesses can create and share knowledge that offers real value to customers while streamlining content workflows and reducing costs. The only question is -- how do you apply these best-practices?\n\nThat's where Docsie comes in. Docsie is founded on these documentation best-practices, applying them automatically to streamline content creation, management, and publishing workflows. The platform is designed to work with all kinds of documentation, closely aligning with typical business DMS requirements. During import and export, Docsie documentation uses open and compatible file formats to increase accessibility. Businesses can read and act on customer documentation feedback using Docsie Vocally, improving the quality of knowledge and reducing content errors. Document versioning allows you to retain historic versions for information-redundancy. Branding and content design frameworks can be set once and applied everywhere with the Customized Documentation Hub. Everything is stored in one location -- the Docsie Portal -- so employees can quickly find a document rather than searching their computer, cloud drive, or email. Permissions can be set to manage GRC, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive documents. Finally, colleagues can chat, share, link, attach, and grant access to contractors for centralized team collaboration on Docsie.\n\nCreate documentation that your customers will love, without the complexity. If your business is looking for a DMS solution, consider giving Docsie a try!

User guides provide your users with simple, step by step instructions on how to use and/or assemble the products.\n\nYour customers need to be educated on the products that you are selling, services you are providing or methods and procedures that they must follow. They offer a step-by-step process in which your customers can learn how to use, and educate themselves on your product's different features and functions.\n\n### Creating proper user guides limits the legal liability of products:\n\nUser guides also limit liabilities of incorrect use of your products. A user guide is very handy for products that may cause potential injuries or even death as a result of not properly using or assembling the product. For example: high-voltage devices, fire generating devises and even lasers require extensive manuals to protect the customer from improper use.\n\n### Creating good user guides save time:\n\nGood quality user manuals share instructions on how-to-use your products which can save a lot of time to your technical team explaining things or sales teams doing demos. A lot of complicated software products require good technical user guides to help their customers learn how to use their products with the highest potential. Software\u2019s are normally bombarded by many features and having the right amount of user guides to fuel the customer with useful information\u2019s can help in the long run to retain customers and save time on explaining how various aspects of the software and complicated products are to be used.\n\n### Educating your customers on your products uses:\n\nEducating customers on technical products is very important. Without proper user guides your customers can be confused by a barrage of hidden features and not know how to use the full potential of the technical product. User guides allow for an easy process in which your customers can learn to engage in the various technical aspects of your product and feel comfortable for having a user guide handy when they need to delve deeper into your products. It will take the stress away from them trying to figure things out without formal written guidance. Also for dangerous-to-use products, user guides can provide warnings against misusing products in a dangerous manner.\n\n\n\n## What makes a great user guide\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_jripxf4mYymO4f3xy/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/fe45270c-c55d-dab5-f45c-363cc455ecb821.png)\n\n\n\nSo to start making a user guide you need to understand what problem you are trying to help solve for a specific customer. Making a user guide for everything about everything turns it into an incomprehensible mess that no one will understand including it's target audience. If you look at some of the best examples of user guides online, written by superstar companies like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/payments?payments=popular) or [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/categories/200111606-Using-Slack). You will notice a particular pattern. \n\n\n\n> Each user guide focuses on solving a particular problem. \n\n\n\nSo what should each guide do? It should focus on simple actions that your user can accomplish while following this guide. There is no need from complication. On the contrary, if you focus on addressing common simple action that helps your users solve common simple problems with your product, you will arrive at having a set of amazing user guides that your customers will love.\n\n\n\nSo let's look closely into a few users guides to understand what is a structure of an amazing user guide so we can take that as a reference point on how we can write an amazing user guide ourselves. \n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_R5PJ3qo7jkogbCKR3/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/ce19c948-7756-658f-003e-05a17c916e7cimage.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## So what goes into a great user guide? \n\nLet's look into the the Managing Book guide above and come up with a few points of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Organizing your user guides\n\n\n\n**Using Docsie to create user guides**\n\nDocsie has various tools and features that allows you to make awesome user guides. Firstly, lets take a look at how Docsie works. Docsie works under the premise of books and shelves and collections.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_8ASkXMSmGFUkhL3h8/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/e263c093-0b3e-b83b-bd9a-38f6cc305cb21.png)\n\nThe collections are used to isolate various books you want to show different type of customers. For example this collection is used to show Business Users only. This means that we selected only 3 books from the all of the books created to show these specific customers.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_4hX2usZ2Cfu8kxDGT/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/b69ec337-f114-7421-8222-ba3bf6c336e12.png)\n\nThis is useful when you have various different types of customers with who are using different tears of your products. This is done seamlessly on Docsie by clicking the three dots next to \u201cAll\u201d and pressing add.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_YGY3TUq04j0YUkBjB/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/c155b6fa-ad22-b5ca-1e6e-3df6b2293e7c3.png)\n\nOnce you are on Docsies Collection tool bar you can create the name of your collection and also pick what user guides you want in this specific collection. The reason why this is important is because different customers may need to know different user guides of your products and this tool allows you to only show the specific user guides they need to see.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_4ez4W22Q45oCMqyi6/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/dfc1562f-cbad-ea86-a55a-cc371063c2634.png)\n\nNow lets get started on writing your first user guide with Docsie, this is done with Docsies \u201cBook\u201d\n\nThink of a book as your user guide or manual. Within your opened book you will see the Editor, a place to create 'Articles' and Headers.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_6H3Y1e38RtMPPxwXp/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/ec59b894-5433-d849-0493-cd836dbe797a5.png)\n\nThe editor on top, the ability to create various version and languages on the top left corner and of course \u201cArticles and subheading sections to the left.\n\nThe editor is simple to use, it allows you to add videos, pictures and code with our simple to use drag and drop process.  Also it allows you to stylize your contect as you see fit.\n\nArticles are really easy to create; just type in your title. In this case the type is \u201cWhat is Docsie\u201d but you can type in whatever you desire for the title of your User Guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_w2Fo0BuxXtGjFQuzx/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/42e5df8b-db8e-ec6a-6a70-dc0420c427376.png)\n\nTo create subsections in your user guides which will appear as 1.1,1.2..ext all you need to do is select the location of your text and set the text as \u2018Header\u201d this is done by clicking the H in the editor tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_OCwuils7ezubiAv8a/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/1dd88460-f856-79c7-96a9-e43c31fd5f217.png)\n\nDocsie also allows you to create various version and languages of your user guides. This is very useful and handy for localization and to talk about various alterations of your product user guides.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_vJFG764JBiJeDM4fU/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/a160f3ac-da2e-37bc-7133-a0172707c2828.png)\n\nOnce you have prepared your user guides, wrote them out, stylized them with photos which helped explain the various aspects of your products and features the next step is publishing.\n\n\n\n\n\n## To summarize, here are the Tips and Tricks for Creating a User Guide\n\nMost software and technical products are very complex and multi-faceted. To address this issue in creating a user guide for complex products it is a good idea to break the information and instruction down into smaller parts. Essentially creating various small user guides and compiling them into a user guide manual set-up\n\n\n\nYour customers are not familiar with your product and or service. The more technical your product the more descriptive your user guides should be in the creation stage. Vague words and phraseology will not be your friend in this process. Be as specific as possible so that your customer can comprehend even the more remedial aspects of your product.\n\n\n\nA picture is worth more than one thousand words. This is true, especially or user guides and manuals. This step is highly neglected by most companies, but having the right photos or snapshots of your product features and aspects of your product while explaining them on your user guides is very important. That way your customer can understand what aspects of your product you are referring to.\n\nYour user guides are designed to help your customers understand the various uses of your products. Explain things in as simple a manner as possible so that they can understand their various features and aspects easily.\n\n\n\n", "header_image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560278674-4a17b808730a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDY2fHxndWlkZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MTk2MjE1MDM&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080", "summary": "Simple Step by Step Guide On Creating User Guides", "publish_date": "May 04, 2021", "categories": ["Product Documentation", "Product Management", "Documentation Portals", "Product Updates", "Best Practices"], "status": 1, "path": "/blog/articles/how-to-create-a-user-guide-in-2021", "slug": "how-to-create-a-user-guide-in-2021", "previous": {"link": "../how-to-win-with-organized-and-automated-product-documentation", "title": "How To Win With Organized And Automated Product Documentation"}, "next": {"link": "../digital-documentation-best-practices-to-inform-and-inspire", "title": "Digital Documentation: Best Practices to Inform and Inspire"}}, {"title": "How To Win With Organized And Automated Product Documentation", "author_name": "Tal F.", "author_email": "tal@docsie.io", "author_info": "VP of Customer Success @ Docsie", "author_image": " https://cdn.docsie.io/user_profiles/15/logo_logo_QmXrbijvL0L2hFKNm6Q25DtjahujKdB6nu4pqBlLBgvtT.png", "author_social": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tal-frenkel-1363b2209/", "markdown": "At Docsie, we bring the power of versatile documentation tools to you. Companies can innovate in the central process of delivering information to every stakeholder in a very particular way \u2013 so that new initiatives and products get the visibility that they need, and everyone is on the same page.\n\n\n\nOrganization And Visual Dashboard Designs\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_ZyQQgNoRzIf0AZalw/boo_6i8Nk6EIN6esFJcNT/807c72cb-8b02-9d4a-f090-398beacaaf8b11.png)\n\nThe Docsie platform works on the principle of pushing product documentation and content to its end user environments in a centralized and organized way. So much of today's software development world is built around this kind of visual dashboard approach, where it's the format and the intuitive interface that matter most.\n\n\n\nWith a great cloud hosted interface, it's easy to unify your product documentation, tackle the learning curve, and publish your content to the web \u2013 seamlessly and effortlessly. That cloud model is very useful \u2013 that\u2019s why cloud services took over twenty-first century business so fully and quickly. But it has to be set up right!\n\n\n\nVirtual Books and Virtual Shelves\n\n\n\nHere's another component of that virtual organization that drives [Docsie\u2019s](https://www.docsie.io/) product documentation processes.\n\n\n\nWithin our interface, you'll see [virtual shelves holding discrete numbers of virtual books](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/using-docsie-library/moving-and-copying-documents/) that contain your content and documentation, and the tools to move items with key automations.\n\n\n\nThis [object-driven mentality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300921) is part of how we help our clients to onboard staff quickly and efficiently, with the system that everyone can learn to use confidently. You could think of it as the \u201cGithub for documentation\u201d \u2013 in many ways, it\u2019s that same process of building a context for information that is popular, easy to understand, and then universally adopted. \n\n\n\nCollaborative Tools\n\n\n\nIn any content process, there are usually multiple stakeholders \u2013 people and parties working together to get the right information to the right destination.\n\n\n\nThat's also a huge part of [how ](https://www.docsie.io/beta/)[Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/beta/)[ works](https://www.docsie.io/beta/), and how we have thoughtfully designed the platform to deliver. Through the documentation workflow processes in our model, it becomes easier to see what each participant is doing within a collaborative pipeline.\n\n\n\nPublishing Automations Make Content Portable\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_FgD6fHcnzlU0hpYDT/boo_6i8Nk6EIN6esFJcNT/8e4935e4-2227-8d61-3946-fa3c1acf78394.png)\n\nEssentially, the[ JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) automations that we built Docsie on are an example of how API documentation tools and related resources work to allow clients to publish anywhere, instead of being confined to one isolated Wordpress silo or other shuttered destination. That versatility is at the core of how a unified documentation and content system releases its goods to the world \u2013 how you move things from drafts or beta into the full production phase.\n\n\n\nWant to learn more about Docsie?

Before a purchase, customers want to understand how a product works and whether it will meet their requirements. During and after a purchase, customers will appreciate documentation detailing how to configure and use your service \u2013 helping them shape and mold functionality to meet their needs.\n\nTo quote Matshona Dhliwayo \u2013 \"Knowledge is wealth.\" Modern digital consumers are privileged to have a wealth of knowledge at their fingertips, courtesy of the internet. For enterprises that lack the capacity or ability to share knowledge on their services \u2013 this means they are losing out on a distinct, information-driven competitive advantage.\n\nThis is confirmed by a recent 2020 [Eptica](https://www.eptica.com/dcx2020)[ study](https://www.eptica.com/dcx2020), where 36% of business respondents are failing to answer routine customer queries via digital channels. In a best-case scenario, these failures will drive up demand in the customer service department as people request information \u2013 increasing staff costs and workloads. The worst-case scenario is customer abandonment. Customers will find a competitor offering more pre- and post-sale documentation, thus improving confidence and the likelihood of following through on a purchase.\n\n\n\n### Answering Routine Queries With a Self-Service Documentation Portal\n\n### \n\nRoutine queries are common, low-level questions concerning aspects of your product or service \u2013 including configuration, billing, and technical support. In most cases, query types will remain consistent, with similar questions being answered with equally similar responses from customer service agents. These low-level workloads are repeatable and predictable, making them ideal candidates for self-service.\n\nBy implementing a self-service documentation portal, businesses can reduce their customer support workloads. This coincides with shifting consumer sentiment. A 2020 [ContactBabel](http://connect.creativevirtual.com/contactbabel-report-us-mar2020)[ study](http://connect.creativevirtual.com/contactbabel-report-us-mar2020) found that 61% of US respondents identified AI-enabled self-service as 'very important.' This demonstrates how customers not only accept contact-free support, they embrace it. In particular, millennials want to serve themselves \u2013 with 73% of consumers in this [Aspect study](https://www.aspect.com/company/news/press-releases/customer-serve-thy-self-new-study-reveals-millennials-desire-for-self-service-digital-interaction-to-change-customer-service-forever) saying they should have the ability to solve problems independently.\n\n\n\n### Using Docsie for WordPress Documentation\n\n### \n\nTo help consumers help themselves, implementing a documentation portal is essential. Docsie is a great way to manage and share documentation across the entire business \u2013 catering to both your loyal customers, and passionate internal employees!\n\n\n\n### Docsie Workspaces, Books, and Shelves\n\nWithin a Docsie workspace, businesses can craft and store documentation to be published in a documentation portal. For individual products, Docsie provides a 'shelf' on which related documentation \u2013 or 'books' \u2013 can be organized and managed. Business users can create as many 'books' and 'shelves' as they require, making Docsie organizable and highly-scalable. This documentation will collectively form a 'library' where staff can add knowledge and customers can use this knowledge to learn about your products and services.\n\n\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/cdhlmjjaoteiufwqsqba)\n\n\n\n### Docsie Document Versioning\n\nDocsie also enables document versioning, keeping multiple iterations of a document organized and available long-term. This is ideal for development teams. New product releases and API updates can be documented, with historical documentation as a backup for customers that continue using older versions of your products and services \u2013 efficiently catering to a fragmented user base.\n\n\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/pczuxadvbygftlmwekbo)\n\n\n\n### Docsie Custom Documentation Hubs\n\nEach brand looks and feels different. Docsie enables custom branding across all documentation, integrating company logos, color schemes, and typography for consistent publishing on company websites. This allows businesses to change branding assets once in Docsie and propagate these changes across all documents on any hosting platform \u2013 streamlining branding management.\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/mshntomlogkgyplixkup)\n\n\n\n### Docsie Machine Learning Language Translation\n\nGlobal enterprises need to communicate knowledge in multiple languages. Docsie provides further management of translated documentation, creating alternative 'books' on each product 'shelf' for different languages. These 'books' can be manually transcribed, or businesses can opt for Docsie's built-in machine translation feature.\n\nMachine translation will automatically translate documents into various languages \u2013 an important feature considering 75% of respondents were more likely to make a purchase if support was provided in their local language, according to a 2020 CSA research [study](https://csa-research.com/More/Media/Press-Releases/ArticleID/655/Survey-of-8-709-Consumers-in-29-Countries-Finds-that-76-Prefer-Purchasing-Products-with-Information-in-their-Own-Language).\n\n\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/tjwcokomcquzbtjfyhms)\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/hpiagizgxcvfteprinwn)\n\n\n\n### Docsie Vocally: Visualized Feedback\n\nDocsie Vocally allows users to provide feedback on individual 'books' in a documentation portal. This helps businesses identify useful and impactful documentation that offers measurable benefits to users. It also helps businesses find non-performant documentation, which should be revised and replaced to offer more value to customers. Feedback consists of 'emotional ratings' on a 5-point rating scale or text messages containing explanations for feedback. Businesses can dive deeper into user experience (UX) monitoring with recorded actions on pages for each user, illustrating customer browsing habits in relation to their feedback to guide business decisions.\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/addifshigkkpoiobortf)\n\n### Getting Started With Docsie on WordPress 5\n\n### \n\nBusinesses can use Docsie's functionality to manage their documentation while hosting items on a platform of their choice \u2013 in this case, WordPress. Publishing to WordPress from within Docsie could not be simpler, requiring a single deployment script to push and publish content.\n\n\n\n### Docsie WordPress Deployment Script Creation\n\nOpen the Book you wish to publish in Docsie.\n\nIn the Settings panel, locate Properties.\n\n\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/pmfgayfjbxpyaezonadq)\n\nClick (get self-publish script)\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/gapavaasxhjgmzvosbtt)\n\nYour code will appear ready to copy into WordPress.\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/eeugiunjmalaxajwytjx)\n\nAdditionally, in the Portal view, businesses can select existing documentation from each shelf or an entire workspace to publish.\n\nIncluded here are Content Filters - Support, Site Content, Terms and Policy, Documentation, Other Pages \u2013 offering granular control over what gets published to WordPress.\n\nBusinesses can also choose Display Styles \u2013 including Version Picker, Language Picker, Section Anchors, Footer Navigation \u2013 controlling the final formatting output on WordPress.\n\nBusiness users simply choose what to publish, defining content filters and display styles through the graphical user interface (GUI) \u2013 with Docsie generating a final deployment script in the lower Text Area. This is known as low-code or codeless.\n\nNow we can publish to WordPress!\n\n\n\n### Adding the Script to WordPress\n\n\n\nAfter logging into the WordPress dashboard, navigate to Pages.\n\nSelect Add new page and create a title, or select an existing page.\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/lbwsgahnmezbvkzftagh)\n\nIn the WordPress text editor, click the Add button on a website block. Select the Custom HTML option to add Docsie\u2019s code script.\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/ejdtdgrlzsahtursowbf)\n\nCopy your deployment script in Docsie to add it to the clipboard. Then in WordPress, paste the code string into your Custom HTML box. You can also specify a WordPress page name, though Docsie will control titling for you automatically in the embedded document.\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/zrmyjvznfrgterpdolmk)\n\nThe final step is clicking Preview next to HTML at the top of the page in the WordPress editor.\n\n![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/eiliooqudyhoghurdeqp)\n\nYour Docsie documentation will appear seamlessly on the page! You can now click Update in the top right to publish to your live webpage. This quick and easy process can be repeated with all of your documentation. It supports rapid publishing for small and large documentation libraries; simply paste and go!\n\nNOTE \u2013 WordPress 5 will show its own title and other website elements using this method, perfect for embedding Docsie documents around other website elements. If you want to load nothing but the Docsie document - paste your code string into the HTML footer of your page in the WordPress Code Editor, and leave the rest of the page blank.\n\n\n\n### Collaborate With Team Members in Docsie\n\n### \n\nDocsie simplifies cross-channel publishing by improving consistency, ease of use, and scalability for large documentation libraries.

For instance, a \u201cread only\u201d version would suffice for sensitive accounting documents.
